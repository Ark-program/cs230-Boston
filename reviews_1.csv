3781,37776825,2015-07-10,36059247,Greg,The apartment was as advertised and Frank was incredibly helpful through the entire process. I would definitely recommend this place.
3781,41842494,2015-08-09,10459388,Tai,"It was a pleasure to stay at Frank's place. The place has everything you need to make it a home base to visit or work downtown.  It is close to Maverick square which is 5 min train ride to downtown Boston.  Parking is a breeze here if you drive in, lot of street parking plus a private spot.  Frank give you a lot of privacy and very knowledgeable about the area.  I would stay here again next time I am in Boston."
3781,45282151,2015-09-01,12264652,Damien,"The apartment description is entirely faithful, and the building very well maintained. A/C, laundry and other utilities are all very convenient. There is a nice view of the harbor from the back of the building, which lends itself well for a quiet, relaxing evening. Frank was very helpful throughout the duration of the stay. I'd recommend it in a heartbeat."
3781,49022647,2015-09-30,41426327,Mike,"Thoroughly enjoyed my time at Frank's home. Had all amenities, was very clean and accommodating. I was very happy with the location and having private lock and gate parking. Lots of great food in the neighborhood and a fantastic view of the seaport. Theres a good chance I will be back in Boston next year for work and will definitely be looking to stay here again!"
3781,52503327,2015-10-30,15151513,Ivan,"Great value for the money! This location has exceeding my expectations. 
<br/>
<br/>1. Photos don't do justice to the place. It's very cozy and homely. 
<br/>
<br/>2. The location is very convenient. It's a five minute walk to the airport (so you really don't have to hire a cab to get to the house if you're coming by plane). You can take the Silver Line bus from the airport, which takes you to South Station, with a stop at the Convention Center. The ride to the city is free ! Those buses take off every 6-10 minutes or so. 
<br/>
<br/>3. Despite being close to the airport, the house is very calm, and I didn't have any trouble sleeping -- and I'm *VERY* sensitive to noise, so it means that the place is indeed very calm. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>4. Responsive but not overbearing host. A pleasure dealing with."
3781,63371931,2016-02-22,55456499,John-Mark,"Frank was very accommodating throughout my stay in East Boston. He is easy to reach via text, phone, or email. Frank provided detailed instructions for entry allowing for a seamless transition from airport to residence. 
<br/>
<br/>Upon entry it is clear that Frank takes pride in a clean and presentable home. If you're in need of a home away from home whether for business or leisure this is your spot! 
<br/>"
3781,67909504,2016-04-01,55456499,John-Mark,Excellent! This was my second stay at the Jeffries St location and once again Frank was an extraordinarily helpful and accommodating host. If business brings me back to the East Boston area I will not hesitate reaching out for a third stay. 
3781,97906006,2016-08-28,88528884,Elisa,"Frank was a wonderful and accommodating host. He was responsive to any questions I had. The place is exactly as described and pictured. It was very clean and orderly. When I arrived, the check in process was smooth and easy. The place is ideally located close to the Harbor Walk and a short walk away from water taxis and other public transport into downtown Boston. My three night stay was enhanced by the well equipped kitchen and restaurants in walking distance. It was perfect for my weekend in Boston!"
3781,105143774,2016-09-30,1342806,Nicole,"Frank was great, the apartment has everything we need, including parking and the neighborhood is lovely!  So close to the water, restaurants, train and the airport (8 min walk!)"
3781,129692749,2017-02-01,55126634,Carlos,Very nice. Comfortable apartment. Good location. Frank is very nice person. 
3781,155725362,2017-05-28,117390053,Carolyn,"Apartment was everything described. Very clean and within walking distance from the airport. Had to get on a bus to take you to the subway, which was ""sketchy"" at night. Other than that is was good. "
3781,184356065,2017-08-19,70187382,Justin,"Frank's place is in a great part of East Boston.  The location is nice and quiet (the airport noise isn't really that bad here), but it's pretty close to the blue line which makes it an easy hop into the city.  There are great jogging trails nearby and the Pier Park around the corner is beautiful.  It's not a super fancy apartment but everything is in working order and it's a comfortable place to stay.  I also think you get good value for your money here since East Boston is still considerably cheaper than most of the rest of the city.  Overall, I recommend the place!"
3781,194026175,2017-09-15,11888800,John,"Franks' place is the ground floor unit in a 3 storey wooden multi-family house, with Frank living upstairs.  The apartment is comfortable and was ideal for my 4 week stay with great cooking facilities and more spacious than a studio.  It's a few yards to the harbourside, and a 15 minute walk to the airport.  The nearest Metro station is about a mile away but then its just 1 stop to Boston city.  East Boston is a blue-collar area that is up-and-coming due to its convenience and harbour views but don't expect much in the way of trendy cafe's or restaurants.  The ones there are are typically Italian or Latino and cater to the locals rather than tourists.  There is KO Pies nearby, run by a bunch of Aussies keen to educate New Englanders on the delights of the aussie meat pie, and well worth a visit.  There are great parks nearby and excellent jogging routes.  Franks place would suit a couple but not a family as there's just one double bed.  In terms of value for money, Franks is unbeatable and is a great place to base yourself for a Boston visit or a long-term stay."
3781,284969158,2018-07-02,173840231,Artur,"Great place, amazing city, fantastic host!!!"
3781,415389126,2019-02-22,83031353,Norman,My partner and I stayed at Frank's apartment for several months and it was a great experience! Frank is accommodating and thoughtful in our needs while also giving us a good amount of privacy. Location is great as it's in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Would  definitely stay here if I have to be in this area in the future!<br/>Thanks!
3781,579765013,2019-12-21,3918963,Antoine,I liked very much this apartment rented by Frank. The place was perfectly clean with every think that I needed for a middle-long stay in Boston.  Frank is a great host that is very responsive and made everything to facilitate my stay. I liked also very much the neighborhood with the piers literally at the end of the street and the nice Piers park at 5 min walk. I'd highly recommend it to everyone!
3781,659896032,2020-09-03,344701185,Ugur,"I stayed at Frank's apartment for three months and my stay was excellent! The neighborhood is lovely and quiet, the apartment was just as described, very orderly and clean, and it comes with all the amenities you need. Perfect for a long stay in Boston."
3781,716793055,2020-12-20,348888007,Josiah,"Wonderful 1 bedroom with a great location! The apartment amenities were perfect for a long-term stay and its proximity to many parks provided wonderful views of Boston and the harbor. The walkable location made it easy to reach many businesses on foot, and the private driveway made parking and commuting outisde of Boston a breeze. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here!"
3781,734556136,2021-02-26,345613836,Justin,Great place - amazing location.   Highly recommend.
3781,753337824,2021-04-30,60267441,Alison,"This apartment is perfect for short or long term stays. It's cozy and has everything you could need. I especially loved the location, being able to walk along the harbor and bike up to the beaches."
3781,414455061186199349,2021-07-25,387513970,Ana,"I stayed at this apartment for three months and it was perfect. Short walk to public transportation, a lot of nice parks nearby, and the apartment itself was exactly as described. The kitchen is well-equipped and there was a desk provided which made working from home easy. Frank is also easily reachable by phone and was quick to respond if I needed help or had any sort of questions. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend to others."
3781,551392073608895793,2022-01-30,387833418,Alexa,Great location for long or short term stays. I stayed here on my 13 week work assignment in Salem (which is about 30-40 minute drive depending on traffic) and loved every minute of my stay here! The location is great with great views of Boston skyline and harbor a short walk away and close to the train that takes you into Boston! East Boston itself is a hidden gem with the great views and delicious food spots! Pictures don’t do this spot justice .. it’s a cute homey place to stay and would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area! Frank and Margo were great hosts always responsive and there to help!
3781,637654921682183182,2022-05-29,51090123,Carolina,"Great place to spend a few months in Boston. The place is just as described and in a quiet area in East Boston by the water. It’s a quick walk to the airport and the blue line. Frank was very nice and communicative throughout our whole stay, would definitely come back here in the future!"
3781,709378621413479089,2022-09-05,69554381,Mhoire,Great place.  Great neighborhood. Loved it
3781,1044319916402714634,2023-12-11,509327273,Shruthan,I stayed here for 17 weeks from Aug-Dec 2023. The place is as described in the description and I concur with the other positive reviews for the apartment.
5506,1021,2009-03-21,8903,Jenny,Terry's Hotel Alterntv in Boston was a perfect place to stay for myself and my partner.  We mixed our trip with business and pleasure and found the room perfectly appointed for our needs and affordable.  A great stay!
5506,1953,2009-05-01,12970,Clint,Warm and accommodating host. Beautiful and well appointed room.
5506,10089,2009-09-14,14033,Nicolas,"We stay 3 nights at the Hotel Alternative and have complete confort, sweet bed and a very nice welcome.
<br/>Close to the metro, here is the ideal place for a discovering trip town!!!"
5506,18678,2009-11-29,51993,Sarah,"We stayed in the private room.  Terry provided a mini fridge and microwave, bath products, guidebooks, soft sheets and fluffy towels.  We were very cozy despite it being a blustery winter weekend.  Downtown Boston was visible from our room on the 3rd floor and, though the T was nearby, we enjoyed walking into town.  What a good value-- we'd stay there again in a heartbeat.   "
5506,24467,2010-01-19,68674,LaJuan,Stayed here recently during a conference and the accomodations were fantastic!  Terry is very laid back  and very hospitable.  The location is great.  I used mass transit most of the time and the conference sites I visited were very accessible.  I would highly recommend this experience as an alternative to an overpriced hotel.  
5506,25958,2010-02-13,47993,Juan Carlos,"My partner and I stayed for a week at Terry's during our vacation and it was a great experience.  We were happy with our decision to stay there.  The space is comfortable; we were able to relax.  The room is very close to the train, so it was easy to hop on the train and get around Boston and come back to our room whenever we wanted.  We felt welcomed, safe, and comfortable.  I would recommend it without hesitations."
5506,26888,2010-02-19,68528,Deborah,"Terry is welcoming and helpful.  The condo was lovely - thoroughly applianced kitchen, gorgeous bathroom,  comfortable lounge and cosy bed. I felt very at home and it was easy to get in to Boston, with loads of useful information, mpas, books etc.  The only small niggle is that the staircase to the bedroom was a surprise! but otherwise thank you for a wonderful warm stay"
5506,28570,2010-03-07,41492,Tiffany,"I stayed at Terry's for 3 nights. The guest room was great! Very clean, and everything as promised was there. Terry's attention to detail and small details were much appreciated. Much better value compared to a hotel! Would definitely stay there again :-) "
5506,43996,2010-05-19,101258,Jessica,"This was a wonderful place to stay. The location was good, close to the train, and the place itself was beautiful, clean and just what we needed for our weekend away. We stayed in a smaller room the first night and then moved to a larger room after. It was nice to have the extra space and full kitchen. Although we did not see our host, we had plenty of communication via message as well as many things left for us in the room. Would definitely recommend. "
5506,46494,2010-05-26,95028,Lois,"Stayed over Terry’s place back in May, and we were very happy about the room.  Terry is a very friendly and informative guy, and very quick in replying emails.  He got maps, attraction spots and restaurant tips all planned out ready to pick up in the room, and he takes his time to explain to us where we were, and how to get to one point to another. The room we stayed was very charming and clean.  It has everything you need, and we loved the bathroom.  It is only minutes away from the subway station and bus stops, and takes only 10 to 15 minutes to go everywhere. Thanks a lot, Terry!  We had a good time. "
5506,105114,2010-09-26,94525,Alan,"A wonderful old house full of character.  Terry was a very good host and was very helpful in all aspects.  Our room was was five star, beautifully fitted out and extremely clean.  I would recommend this accommodation 
<br/> to anyone.  My only fault was that our apartment was at the top of two flights of quite steep stairs, so was a little difficult with suitcases.  "
5506,112087,2010-10-05,130491,June,"the only reason I have not given 5stars is although terry advertises under bed and breakfast no breakfast is provided.prhaps i didnt read the info properly when i booked .otherwise very nice room  with tea and coffee provided
<br/>june and john from barry south wales"
5506,136665,2010-11-10,240690,Laura,"Everything was perfect about our stay at Terry's place...
<br/>-the location was in a nice neighborhood just at the edge of the city, with a 15-20 min subway ride to center city Boston (the subway station is only a 5 min walk from Terry's place)
<br/>-Immaculately clean and comfortable room, with fresh sheets, towels, and everything else you might need for your stay (tons of tourist guidebooks, toiletries, fridge, coffee maker, snacks, etc)
<br/>-We did not get to see Terry, but he was accessible by phone even at late hours and was very helpful in making sure we got into our room okay
<br/>
<br/>I highly recommend Terry's place, and if you visit Boston definitely do the Freedom Trail Walk that starts at Boston Common!"
5506,142968,2010-11-22,284952,Brendan,"I felt very welcomed at Terry's Hotel Alternative, I felt like I was staying at a friends house. Terry provides plenty of local information, he's very chilled and laid back and is very helpful. The location is great, less than 5 minute walk to the Roxbury Crossing underground, although you can walk into town in about 20mins. I have no hesitation in recommending Hotel Alternative and would happily stay again if I'm back in Boston."
5506,186537,2011-02-22,361042,William,"My fiance and I could  not have asked for more from our stay at the Fort Hill Inn.  Terry, our host, was very welcoming as well as helpful, leaving us maps and suggestions of things to do.   The room was beautiful, cozy and clean.  The neighborhood was quiet and a great location; a very easy, short trip to downtown.
<br/>We will not only  be staying here for future trips to Boston but will also be recommending it to any family or friends planning to visit the area."
5506,213591,2011-03-31,339294,Cate,"Very comfortable, homely, quiet and private accommodation within easy walk of the T. Fridge and coffee maker as well as crackers provided. Stereo and TV. Walk up narrow 2 flights of stairs to own apartment not a challenge, except when loaded with luggage and then not really!  Terry is very hospitable whilst not intrusive.
<br/>
<br/>Would stay here again."
5506,241376,2011-04-26,443469,Grace,"The place was perfect : clean, comfortable, and conveniently located. Really private and cozy room!
<br/>We very much enjoyed our stay. 
<br/>Thank you, Terry! "
5506,423146,2011-08-06,600724,Christoph,Everything was just perfect - Terry was a very friendly host and supplied us with lots of very useful information - thank you!
5506,476515,2011-08-26,644628,Jean-Etienne,"This is really a great location. The street is quiet and the room is really great. The bed is confortable. Terry is really helpfull.
<br/>
<br/>Enjoy."
5506,584574,2011-09-30,1021326,Jared,"When I first arrived we had a slight mix up with our dates but Terry soughted it all out for me within an hour and I was good to go!
<br/>The house has a heap of character and my room was a lot better than I had first expected.  The bedroom was big, the shower had a tonne of pressure, and the bed was super comfy. I got an awesome nights sleep before having to fly half way around the world.
<br/>
<br/>Overall Terry is a top bloke and I would definately recommend his accommodation to anyone looking to stay in Boston.
<br/>
<br/>(close to trains and buses as well)."
5506,625414,2011-10-13,1017520,Dave,"Nice and cozy room, tasteful decor. Very comfy to stay with cable, wifi and some snacks that Terry so thoughtfully provided. The 3 level walk up can be a bit of a challenge if you have lots of luggage coming in or out. Overall, an enjoyable stay!!"
5506,630562,2011-10-16,967793,Juana,We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed it. The room is cosy and comfortable. There was everything you need. We could also store our baggage for some hours after check out. One star removed due to location. Seems a bit remote but easy access with tram.
5506,654402,2011-10-23,922457,DavId,"La habitación y el baño estaban  limpios. La casa está muy cerca del metro, y a pocas paradas del centro de la ciudad. Terry nos recibió muy bien."
5506,714099,2011-11-13,1335134,Crystal,"Terry was accessible and friendly. We had a great stay in Boston with no complaints. The location is in walking distance to the T and it worked well for us to explore the city. Thanks for a great stay, Terry! "
5506,877398,2012-01-23,1386710,Celine,"It's the first time we been to Boston, and the place is much better than we expect. The host, Terry, was so friendly, and the set up of the room was amazing! We enjoyed the stay there. Thanks to the host."
5506,952552,2012-02-27,1634179,YoungKee,"I stayed in Terry's inn for a month. It was very comfortable & enjoyable. It was located very close to the T stop, to the train station and also to the bus stop. It only took about 15min by feet to the Brigham & women's hospital where I had to go everyday. Thank you Terry. "
5506,1347371,2012-05-25,2334159,Sarah,"I came to Boston for some meetings and was looking for a quiet, private, and inexpensive place to stay and work. This fit the bill quite well. The place is really easy to get to on public transportation and Terry's directions were perfect. It's a quiet neighbourhood so if you're looking to be right in the middle of things, you might want to stay closer to the city centre. But if you're looking for a quiet place to stay with easy access to everything via the T, this is a great spot. Thanks Terry!"
5506,11724780,2014-04-13,8497435,Evgueny,"+ the room is wonderful and very clean
<br/>+ bathroom very nice and fully equipped
<br/>+ 5 min walk to metro and then10-15min to center 
<br/>+ 30-40min nice walk to center Boston
<br/>+ quiet neibourhood
<br/>+ Terry is very helpful (didnt see him much but he left Boston documentation in room)
<br/>
<br/>- neiborhood is ok
<br/>- not in the missel of the city
<br/>"
5506,19073192,2014-09-06,17307923,Nick,"I had a really nice stay here for a little over two weeks, I was studying near the Brigham and Women's hospital so the location was great for me considering I could walk there in about 15-20 minutes. Terry was really good, always replying straight away if I needed anything. The place was really comfortable and homely so I's recommend it to anyone."
5506,19338385,2014-09-10,15755618,Patrick,"This is a great location to serve as ""base camp"" to explore Boston.  The T is right down the hill, easy to find and quick to different parts of town.  The room and bath were comfortable and we had good nights of rest.  All in all it was a very fine place to rest and relax."
5506,32296876,2015-05-16,32602643,Sheryl,"Both of Terry's apartments I stayed in were exceptional!  He sets the bar high on all fronts: beautifully decorated, clean, spacious, comfortable, affordable & full of amenities.  Easy communication & check-in/out. Great location, lovely neighborhood & FREE street parking (practically in front of the place). The 1st 2 nights I stayed at the 2 bedroom duplex apartment. My first night was at the tail end of a heat wave (it was 88 degrees out) but Terry's place was perfectly cool & comfortable. The a/c was on when I got there, with a few lights & low background music making it very welcoming. The 3rd night I was in the Private Room & Bath  which was also very lovely. It was well-equipped, and great to have the microwave and mini-fridge (there's plates/silverware and just about anything you could need in the cabinet). I slept well on the very comfy beds at both places. Glad I got to meet Terry as I was leaving:)... (though he had been available & we communicated through text during my stay). Would highly recommend & stay again, Thanks Terry!"
5506,35141899,2015-06-15,24289205,Steve,"Had a wonderful stay at Terry's place in Fort Hill, Boston.  Room was very nicely decorated and had excellent wifi.  Bathroom was cool with an old claw-foot tub.  Bed was comfy and there was plenty of drawer space for my stuff.  Terry was very charming and helpful as a host.  HIghly recommend this place!  Parking is just a few feet away from the building and there were always spaces available.  Also close to public transportation."
5506,54255820,2015-11-17,46733641,Janet,Terry welcomed us upon arrival and was extremely accommodating to our stay.  We felt at home and our expectations were better than we imagined.  The experience here was memorable and definitely a must  to visit again.  A FIVE star experience! 
5506,61490061,2016-02-05,52150233,Nayef,"The place were very clean +++\+++  , Terry was very nice and very very helpful in whatever you asked him ...
<br/>I strongly recommend you guys to go there...
<br/>The place was near the T (orange line) 4 minutes and it takes about 10 minutes to reach BWH by bus and about 15 minutes by feet. 
<br/>A lot of markets , restaurant  around. 
<br/>It was a fantastic experience!! "
5506,68035397,2016-04-01,56664093,Xiangyang,"Amazing place for staying at Boston, strongly recommend, a hospitable host, a comfortable environment, a perfect rate."
5506,78709514,2016-06-08,5242100,Rosemary,"I didn't have an opportunity to meet Terry, but my room at the Inn was very comfortable and well appointed. I appreciated the air conditioning on two of my three nights there, as the humidity was pretty high for the first few days of my visit. The well equipped kitchenette in the corner of the room came in handy too. I really enjoy staying in residential neighborhoods, rather than at big downtown chain hotels. This was ideal for me. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a notebook with information about local restaurants and things to see. I didn't make use of that as I was here for a workshop, but it was a nice touch. A very charming place to stay. I'd stay there again next time I have to be in the Longwood Medical area."
5506,100036800,2016-09-07,92150619,Don,Wonderful room in brownstone.  Tons of character. Every amenity desired was in the room. Great mini kitchen (microwave w sink and mini fridge). Clean and roomy bathroom. 
5506,114892486,2016-11-20,6802028,Stela,"Great location with easy access to public transport, very clean room and bathroom. Was exactly as described. Loads of towels and soap, shampoo, nice coffe making facilities and coffee and tea provided. Nice and quiet neighbourhood. The host was very friendly, always answered our queries promptly, clear instructions and explanations how to find the place and how to access the room. We have not met Terry, but were very impressed with the quality of the services he provided. Thank you Terry and we would definetely recommend the place to our friend and of course if we visit Boston again we would love to stay at your place again. "
5506,151867102,2017-05-14,25201342,Leasa,Convenient to south side of Boston and many universities.  Orange line is a five minute walk from the apartment.  Would have liked a more current listing of food establishments but nothing Yelp or Google couldn't assist.
5506,152641470,2017-05-17,4769445,Dave,"Every single thing was exactly as I expected based on the listing and the advance information Terry sent. This is the way every single business should work - in fact how every part of life should work. The room experience precisely matched my expectation, everything was comfortable. <br/>And I can't say enough about how responsive and helpful he was. Amazingly, even when my car got towed (my mistake) he drove me to get it.  All in all, I find myself hoping I'll have another need to come to this neighborhood so I can stay here again.  <br/>Note for some to be aware of: I stayed in room 3, 3rd floor, narrow winding staircase, also with a small (but free!) kitchenette - fridge & sink are small, but efficient & effective. The room is furnished cleverly and nicely so it all works well."
5506,161041429,2017-06-16,77794916,Ted,"Great host, accurate to as advertised."
5506,170066131,2017-07-14,138728716,Smart,"Terry was prompt in responding, he was very friendly and his place was extremely beautiful."
5506,174374354,2017-07-25,21751810,Payam,"Terry's place is an old classic Boston house, it is very clean and has everything you would need. To be honest it staying there feels like staying at a 4 star hotel.The washroom and the bed is very nice and clean. The location is a Subway ride (3 stations) away from the interesting part of town."
5506,178975973,2017-08-06,19743517,David,"Very comfortable room with nice bed. You must be able to walk up an old-style, steep staircase for the room we were in (#3).   Many thoughtful extras provided in the room.  "
5506,183537626,2017-08-17,143136424,Zoe,"Terry has sent me all the information to guide me with my next stop before I arrive Boston. When I ‌ch‌e‌c‌k‌ ‌i‌n‌ that I find out Terry has prepared some travel guide on the table, which is very nice to me.<br/>The room is clean and well kept with the nice odor free shower. Also, there are microwave, mini refrigerator, and coffee machine which is very sweet to prepare those in the room. <br/>Terry's room is my first experience on Airbnb, it is very nice and make me have a feeling of home."
5506,187703310,2017-08-27,13132165,Claire,"Room was beautiful, facilities are excellent and communication was great."

5506,211810267,2017-11-14,108158933,Connor,Great spot with a unique decor creating a cozy and welcoming feel. Had everything we needed. Private and clean.
5506,213686339,2017-11-22,103582259,Heather,I had a wonderful time during my stay. Convenient location for the T or bus system to/from Boston. Terry was responsive any time I had a question. I would highly recommend staying here and will again in the future. <br/>Thank you Terry!
5506,218219020,2017-12-11,33122475,Vinu,"I stayed at Terry's place for 6 nights and enjoyed every bit of it. The place is exactly as described in the posting and it's aesthetically decorated. It looked as though I stepped into the colonial era. The amenities are fantastic and the neighborhood is safe. There are multiple choices for restaurants, supermarkets and, coffee shops all located conveniently at a walking distance from the place. I highly recommend this place for its value and would love to stay here in the future! Thanks, Terry!"
5506,224180261,2018-01-02,139011711,Zikar,"It’s a very cozy and comfortable room, located few minuets driving from downtown. <br/>It also gets sunlight via 2 big windows.<br/>Terry was very responsive and helpful with direction and very informative about the location and the room.<br/>I would definitely choose this place in future visits."
5506,231111339,2018-01-30,39681077,Jiadi,It is very cozy place to stay. I stay in room #4 so it’s in the top of the building. The room is very warm and clean with fancy furniture and books. Very good place for couple or individual traveler to stay.
5506,242846937,2018-03-13,72901556,Priyanka,"Such a great find! Close to a t- stop on the orange line, warm, and fully accommodating! Loved staying here, and if I’m in Boston again, I will be using this room!"
5506,245266029,2018-03-21,66936751,Richard,Great place and location
5506,246942974,2018-03-26,142052361,Emily,"Great value! Perfect place if you are planning to be out and about exploring the city and don’t want to spend a fortune for a place to sleep. The place was clean, cozy, and walking distance to public transit. Parking, like in most large cities can be difficult, but we were able to find a spot quickly and close to room. Terry, was responsive and gave good directions/instructions."
5506,247734801,2018-03-29,9173786,Albert,"Great stay, just as advertised.  Booked on very short notice, great communication.  Would stay here again."
5506,249042592,2018-04-01,51944613,Xingrong,"I really love the style of the house! And the location is good as well, very quiet place!"

5506,257521814,2018-04-26,182622878,Bharath,Great place and quite neighborhood.
5506,270890136,2018-05-30,157377051,Patricia,Liked the location close to public transit. Terry was an excellent host. Gave great directions and responded quickly to questions.
5506,272965787,2018-06-04,2800974,Stephanie & Alex,"Really great location (5-6 min walk to Roxbury Crossing Metro), the beds were super comfy and the room was clean & quiet (couldn't hear neighbors or other guests). It was a great first stay in Boston and would happily book here again the next time we visit."
5506,282561512,2018-06-27,196483908,Nadine,"Terry's place is a cozy, quaint, very clean and well-layer-out apartment. The bed was truly very comfortable and we slept well after our days of much city-walking. My daughter and I especially liked having a mini-kitchen with everything we needed to make ourselves hot beverages and keep our snacks and restaurant leftovers refrigerated.  It was a quick 10 minute walk to Roxbury Crossing metro station and from there a 10 minute ride into downtown.  Also, Terry was very quick to respond with any inquiries via email. Really a great place for 2 to stay in Boston!"
5506,283825372,2018-06-30,187130675,Randy,"This was a nice quiet place.  Nice personal touches that made us feel right at home.   About a 10 minute walk to the Roxberry orange line station.  Had everything a person could ask for, comfy bed, seating, a/c, bath/towels, small frig, umbrella, microwave and tv.  Loved the rubber ducky!  Terry was great to work with too.  The steep/narrow stairs to this unit could present those with physical limitations some issues.  Otherwise, it was perfect."
5506,286135589,2018-07-05,154692293,Mark,This was a great place to stay in Boston! Less than 10 minutes walk from a subway station and plenty of parking nearby to not have to worry about driving in the city.
5506,293139023,2018-07-19,97170868,Ian,Great place for its price. Right near the T so you can get anywhere in the city easily.  He provides you with all the necessities and gives you great tips about the city.
5506,297283396,2018-07-27,119946902,Steve,"My wife and I came to Boston for the first time to celebrate our Anniversary. The room was just what we were looking for!We were out all day and it was a great spot to crash and prepare for the next day.  It is an easy 5 minute walk to the T train which will take you to the majority of the places in the City. <br/>The 2 important things we look for is how was the bed and shower.  The bed was very comfy, but seemed to be more of a Full size than a Queen. The shower was great, hot, and had good water pressure.  It is a little tricky getting in as it’s a big step and you need to pull yourself up on the handle. As other reviews have stated, the room is up 3 narrow flights of stairs so plan your luggage accordingly. <br/>A great stay at a great price!<br/>"
5506,300161597,2018-08-01,112123371,Lily,"The place was cozy and had everything we needed. Terry provided a ton of information about transportation, local sites to see and places to eat/drink. "
5506,314996991,2018-08-27,206300131,Meghan,Great place and amazing experience! Highly recommend staying here !
5506,316639509,2018-08-31,76195686,Wan Fung,"Location is only 5 minutes walk to Roxbury Crossing subway station, ride only take 15 minutes to downtown Boston.  Good choice if you only need a place to sleep at night during your trip.  Bathroom and bed is clean too."
5506,318303756,2018-09-03,159154361,Matt,The room is beautiful and feels like a boutique hotel with comfy bed.  Lots of personal and thoughtful touches.   Distance from city centre was more than expected and stairs were as steep as noted in other reviews.   No complaints othan than time passed too fast during our first trip to Boston.
5506,325402761,2018-09-19,213629817,Blake,Great place to stay
5506,328948521,2018-09-27,62454383,E,"Terry is very hospitable and kind, as well as  easy to communicate with. The apartment has a lot of charm and the little interior design details make it welcoming and cozy. Check-in/check-out was a breeze. Good location close to the city and the Universities."
5506,331002176,2018-10-01,29872029,Jane,"Fantastic value if you want a comfortable place to crash after a days sightseeing.  Clean and comfortable. As said before, the stairs are challenge with heavy luggage but 'doable'. Transit lines are close and very easy to navigate.  Check in and out was very smooth and Terry was flexible about storing luggage. I recommend this Inn."
5506,334619187,2018-10-09,23435407,Brenna,"Terry’s place was a great space for a single or couple traveling for a short term in Boston. The bed was comfortable. Room had adequate space, included a closet with hangers, mini fridge, sink, microwave, TV and good lighting. The water in shower was plenty hot for a long shower. Lots of plugs and places to charge. Check in and access to apartment was very easy. My only caution for future renters is that this unit is on third floor (2 flights of stairs). I would caution renting if you have mobility issues or a lot of large luggage. I also did not feel very comfortable walking very far in this neighborhood. However the Uber system and drivers in the area are fantastic!!!"
5506,339588793,2018-10-21,113831095,Chris,This place was amazing!!! great location and easy to get to many places within the city. Cozy room with amenities that make your stay very comfortable. The building has a very historic vibe and the light fixtures and bathroom made for a fun atmosphere. Easy keypad access that feels safe and great tips on fun things to do in Boston. The host was very responsive and we would definitely stay here again!
5506,341663276,2018-10-27,188968784,Tony,Very authentic Boston apartment. In a nice and quiet area. Host was very helpful and all directions were perfect! Would definitely recommend to others. We had an amazing time here!
5506,345952572,2018-11-06,2941836,Holly,Very cozy and comfortable studio space. It was perfect for our trip while we went sightseeing for most of the days and the comfy bed was just what we needed after a long day out in the city.
5506,347692748,2018-11-11,88041349,Kae,"It was very cute, clean and cozy place, and everything you may need is there. Thank you for letting us to stay at your place, we loved it!"
5506,348618908,2018-11-14,29668430,Zhengzhou,Good and clean overall. It’s in an old neighborhood a little bit far away from downtown. But close to train station.
5506,350194035,2018-11-18,58561712,Ashley,"Awesome room at an unbeatable price! The only downfall was that we weren’t able to figure out the heat in the room. Regardless of what we did, at night it would get super hot. The a/c unit was still in so we turned on the fan and all was well. The description is very accurate. The free parking was so simple and SO worth the easy commute downtown. Riding the T was easy and safe. I had a conference at the Hynes Convention Center and it took about 20 minutes to get door-to-door. Super cost effective and super adorable. We would definitely stay again!"
5506,413964079,2019-02-18,18892960,Chankrit,"The place was awesome for the price!! MUST stay here when you’re in the area. Close to the metro but we uber’d into downtown etc and it was relatively cheap. Clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated! Loved it"
5506,425115071,2019-03-17,138063728,Mick,"Could not have chosen a better spot for my first stay in Boston! Absolutely loved the place. It was like a stay in a boutique hotel. Gorgeous “old school” building, comfy bed, quiet surroundings and all the right thoughtful extras. 5 minute walk to Roxbury Crossing Station and a 10 minute subway ride to downtown. Checking in/out couldn’t have been easier and Terry and Mindy were great hosts, quick to respond to any questions that I had. <br/>I couldn’t recommend a stay here more. Do yourself a favour. 🍀<br/>Mick<br/>Toronto"
5506,430450382,2019-03-30,16538334,Dean,Easy to find. Just look for the intersection of Malcolm X Boulevard and the Muslim mosque with the tall spire.
5506,434815683,2019-04-08,24150756,Rachel,"The studio is quiet and charming, conveniently located to transportation, and the bed is so comfortable. Terry and Mindy thought of everything. Much as though I wish the heating could be better controlled, I recognize that it is a well-maintained charming old building. Overall, it was a lovely and relaxing stay."
5506,437963429,2019-04-15,25357960,Lenore,"Honestly, it worked out perfectly for us.  Access to the subway/transit station was so close, the room was fun and funky, neighbourhood felt safe and quiet, bed was comfortable.  The only thing I would stress is that this would not be a good choice for someone with mobility issues.  The stairs are narrow and steep, and the walk to the subway/transit station included a steep hill.  We definitely got in a workout everyday!  :)  Otherwise, we were extremely satisfied."
5506,448671892,2019-05-05,251585068,Mauricio,Nice cozy place with very good communication to other interesting places of Boston
5506,451993810,2019-05-12,137645951,Stephan,Wonderful and clean apartment in a quiet neighbourhood with easy access to public transportation. Well-organized and friendly host. I would be pleased to visit again in the future.
5506,454075163,2019-05-17,23485303,Mark,"Amazing value. Clean, well maintained, and has everything one needs. Nice, quiet neighbourhood. Easy walk to the subway line. Straightforward checkin."
5506,459494335,2019-05-27,162597826,Yifan,"Terry was very responsive and accommodating!  We needed some special arrangements since we were traveling with our 13-month old. He was super helpful and made it really easy for us. <br/>I didn't realize unit 3 was on the third floor without elevator. I would have booked ground floor if I knew that earlier. We did have to carry stroller, baby and stuff quite a few times."
5506,462862073,2019-06-02,120600610,Robert,Great place; close to train; super value.
5506,470740939,2019-06-16,134311588,John,"A beautiful apartment full of character. Exactly as described, and very clean."
5506,472881546,2019-06-20,85691724,Nadia,"Nice place. Not close to the middle of ""town"" as i had thought but a short walk to the T and a quick ride to all the places there is to see. A seemingly sketchy neighborhood but I never had any issues and over all quiet. Everyone in Boston is very friendly and if you don't want to take the T an uber is only around $15 or less to the center of stuff."
5506,475032819,2019-06-23,50915491,Kaitlin,"Great spot to stay when visiting Boston. Not much in the immediate area, but it’s only about a block to the T which gets you everywhere. Very cute building. Very clean."
5506,476114766,2019-06-25,116120371,Julius,Super cute and quiet with a old charm. Loved every second.
5506,479838040,2019-07-01,42235389,Shawn,"Everything was as described. Great place! Quick communication and very easy check-in. I was a bit concerned before arriving because Roxbury isn’t known to be the safest area in Boston but the neighborhood Terry’s place is in appeared quite safe. I probably wouldn’t wander around at midnight but the place is pretty close to the Roxbury crossing T stop, which made it convenient to get in and out of downtown. Overall an excellent place! Would stay here again!"
5506,485852298,2019-07-11,77852709,Tom,The guest room is very stylishly decorated and clean. The location is very close to a subway line that will get you into town in 5 minutes. They were very quick responders and were very helpful. Check in was very easy.
5506,496490159,2019-07-27,96450661,Joey,Location was right by a subway station which made getting around super easy. Would definitely consider staying there again.
5506,511639259,2019-08-17,226344213,Harriet,Fabulous apartment in a good location! The decor was very quirky and fun. The hosts left a great folder with lots of very useful information and tips in it which really helped us find our way around and pointed us to some great food locations! Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again if we visit Boston again! Thank you very much!
5506,514648158,2019-08-21,285527325,Stephane,Nice place for a cozy stay!
5506,517688356,2019-08-25,7671842,Abigail,"This is a lovely inn located in the Roxbury neighborhood outside of the center of Boston.  Our room was super comfortable and very clean.  The neighborhood was great in terms of safety and very quiet.  If you don't need to be right in the center of Boston, this is your place!"
5506,523478569,2019-09-03,278074749,Sharon,"The room had everything we needed ( iron, microwave, fridge, laundry) and everything was in working order. We really appreciated being able to store our luggage before check-in. Loved the easy walk to the T station and to Berklee. So easy to go wherever we needed to go. Would definitely stay here again!! Thank you."
5506,528759942,2019-09-13,146257717,Nancy,We had a wonderful time at Terry’s. We never actually met him ( which I like ! No offence Terry!)<br/>Any questions we had which really was about leaving luggage was answered promptly. Easy access to apartment too. We really liked the quirkiness about it and it was spotlessly clean. 5 min walk to the nearest subway. Terry left a book with lots of recommended eating places and we actually ate at most of them . Very comfy bed and the pillows were just perfect! <br/>I noted that a couple of people had said it wasn’t in the safest area? A lot of rubbish.<br/>When we arrived a very nice couple with their dog came across the road and asked if they could help ( we were looking at a map at the time ) We ate at the wee restaurant at the <br/>bottom of the hill and they couldn’t have been nicer. We highly recommend Terry’s property<br/>and will definitely be back to the wonderful city of Boston.
5506,536411851,2019-09-26,3045769,Michael,"Great location, very clean and overall a great experience."
5506,545557740,2019-10-12,138407366,Becky,"Great place to stay in Boston!  The room was so charming!  It was very clean with great amenities and the walk was only a couple minutes to the subway, which was a really convenient way to get downtown and much cheaper than an Uber. I’d definitely stay here again in the future."
5506,547586320,2019-10-15,95680474,Lisa,"Das Zimmer ist nett eingerichtet und sehr gemütlich. Es gibt alles was man braucht. Mit dem Codeschloss ist der Check in super easy. In dem Viertel haben wir uns nicht viel aufgehalten, aber man kommt von hier schnell mit der Bahn nach Boston. Die Lage ist also für Sightseeing nicht schlecht. Gerne buche ich das Zimmer wieder auf meinem nächsten Trip nach Boston!"
5506,557253379,2019-10-31,77329533,Jill,"This space is very stylish with antiques and artwork that make if feel very warm. The bed was quite comfortable, and there is plenty of closet space too. The room is about a 5-10 minute walk from the nearest T station which was very convenient for us. Please note that this room is on the third floor, so you walk up two flights of narrow stairs to get there. All in all, this space is a great value and we were happy to have found it."
5506,623543153,2020-05-01,319033161,George,Nice place with old school feel

5506,723232503635484871,2022-09-24,184880341,Yi-Pei,Terry's place was great! It was clean and accurate like the listing described. It is only a 5-minute walk to the Roxbury Crossing station.

5506,736929870330766867,2022-10-13,271340217,Fabio,"Great staying at this Airbnb! If you have lots of luggage, plan to move there with an Uber, because it’s up on a nice hill, but you wouldn’t like to move with your luggage up there! Very comfortable room, with everything you need; we’ll explained in all details, once to book it! Thanks for everything, ladies!"
5506,760863583604607506,2022-11-15,412803770,Debra,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Fort Hill Inn.  The historic building with all of it’s quaint features makes it a unique and charming place to stay.  The close proximity to the orange line made it very easy to get around.  The mini kitchen with coffee and small fridge was an added and useful convenience.  Checking in and out could not have been easier.  Five stars!
5506,775406262802555959,2022-12-05,168062739,Shreena,Terry is an excellent and kind hostess. She was very responsive and helpful throughout our stay. The area is private and safe. The guidebook was helpful and informative. Close to the T but definitely will take 15-20 minutes to get anywhere. Super cute and cozy old Boston home
5506,965234621483074831,2023-08-24,244427805,Sarah,Enjoyed the small old Boston hotel feel. Everything was as described.

5506,1142065496295703819,2024-04-24,34062709,Natalia,"Очень чисто, очень тихо. Чудесный район, пасторальная атмосфера. Большая комната с красивой ванной и удобной кухней. Чистота идеальная, обставлено со вкусом. Все продумано и удобно. Да, надо подниматься по лестнице. Людям с инвалидностью и очень пожилым это жилье не подойдет. Все прочие получат удовольствие и прекрасно отдохнут. Спасибо, Терри, за твою заботу, внимание и такт."
6695,6826,2009-08-06,25094,Jaelen,"Terry's apartment is beautifully decorated and feels like a home away from home. Kudos especially to the kitchen, which was really fully furnished. We had a great time cooking in his kitchen. The subway is within walking distance, and downtown isn't too far away either. Thank you Terry for hosting us :)"
6695,8063,2009-08-23,24420,Patrick,"We stayed in the private home / condo. A nice and quiet appartment. Very tastefull furnished and decorated. We really felt home !
<br/>The only improvement we suggested to Terry is to replace the queensize bed by a bed with a larger size.
<br/>Terry is easygoing. We had a great time in Boston ! 
<br/>Thanx for the hospitality.

6695,10653,2009-09-19,34638,Kay,Terry's apartment has everything we needed. We loved his flowers and enjoyed his kitchen tremendously!  Terry is very thoughtful and accommodating. He even has all kind of maps and tourist information prepared for first time visitors like us. What a great host!  
6695,21716,2009-12-29,39051,Gerard,"I stayed here for a week over Christmas and it couldnt have been a nicer place to stay, Terry stayed away (thought i wouldnt have minded him saying hello)so it made the place feel like my own home with me being able to come and go at my leasure and he even left out some things to make my stay even more enjoyable. Location is great once you know how to use the quick train service into Boston. Only down side was it seemed that the heating was on only when it was turned on up stairs and the radiator was very noisy, other than that, a great place to stay."
6695,26412,2010-02-15,50820,Lam,"I spent my Valentine at Terry's place and he left a beautiful bottle of wine and some chocolate that day. I really appreciated his kindness and the place was marvelous. 
<br/>
<br/>Thank you Terry"
6695,40156,2010-05-05,78882,Patrick,"Spacious, modern and spick-and-span aparment which is located close to the city centre. The three of us really enjoyed our stay at Terry's. You can contact him whenever you have questions, he's really helpful and in overall a fantastic host!"
6695,42342,2010-05-14,2798,Ayeh,"Terry's apartment is very nice, well-stocked and central. It has easy access to all kinds of public transport and is just a terrific place to stay for making the most of Boston. We were attending a conference that had us hopping to meetings and events all over Boston and Cambridge, but were always able to make it back easily using public transportation, even after the subway closed. The kitchen is a wonderful place to gather here and Terry is a very thoughtful, attentive, and accommodating host himself. Would really love to return again."
6695,47300,2010-05-29,58086,Anthony,"The apartment was well located, close to subway and with easy on street free parking. It was comfortable and well furnished and equipped. Terry was a very helpful and friendly host. "
6695,299943,2011-06-06,523289,Claire,"We spent four nights in Terry's appartment. The appartment is really nice and cosy with all the equipment needed. It was as if we were at home.  It is conveniently located, next to the subway. The only thing is that the bed could be a bit more comfortable. But overall we really enjoyed our stay in Boston in Terry's house. "
6695,320481,2011-06-18,559778,Cristina,"It was great lo live in the great and very clean appartment. He was very helpfull in all my requirements.
<br/>Thank you being such a great host.

6695,684710,2011-11-01,1323401,Melodie,"It was our first trip to Boston and it couldn't have turned out better.  Terry's spot has a classic Boston feel with hardwood floors, exposed brick, etc.  The apartment is cozy and has a well equipped kitchen, good heating, DVD player and all the amenities you need.  It's a short walk to the Roxbury Crossing subway station and the overall value is great considering you'd pay double for a decent hotel room in the city.
<br/>
<br/>Terry was a great host and offers tips and tricks for touring the city, grabbing food, etc.  Would highly recommend staying here!
<br/>
<br/>We're a little delayed in reviewing (operator error) :)"
6695,738089,2011-11-22,108180,Andrea,"Terry's place was cosy and spacious.  Everything you needed to have a great stay in Boston was provided including a well equipped kitchen, lots of extra towels, and ample literature on all the sights.  It's about a 5 minute walk to Roxbury Crossing Station which makes it very convenient to get anywhere.  Terry was a wonderful host, responded quickly and easily accommodated our early arrival."
6695,853656,2012-01-09,170957,D L,"Terry's condo was great.  Plenty of space and equipped with quality furniture.  The place has nice style and a very practical living area.  Full kitchen with fridge and appliances, tv with cable, wireless internet, full bath - good stuff.
<br/>
<br/>The location is also accessible and convenient.  I ended up getting the LinkPass for 7 days ($15) which grants unlimited use of the T (subway) and buses.
<br/>
<br/>Terry was a great host and helped me out on short notice.  The place was organized  and stocked with necessities which made me feel at ease.  Thanks, Terry!"
6695,1007386,2012-03-17,1484502,Ilan,"My stay at Terry place was great. The place was perfectly setup with as careful attention to the little details as to the big ones. The neighborhood is not the most central in Boston, but there is plenty of parking which helps when you have a car. Terry was a great host - helpful when needed, and invisible the rest of the time. I'll definitely consider staying there again next time I'm in Boston. The wireless Internet connection was very fast and reliable."
6695,1044812,2012-03-26,1700758,Peter,"Terry was an excellent host and provided us with lots of information about local attractions and transport etc.  The apartment is very comfortable, well furnished and has a 'homely"" feel about it.  Although not of concern to us, the steep stairs to the bedroom would be an issue for anyone with mobility issues.  The neighbourhood does not have many coffee houses, restaurants.shops or tourist attractions although the train station is quick and easy to access and only three stops from the Back Bay area where these facilities are abundant."
6695,1528191,2012-06-21,2101074,Steve,"The apartment was clean, comfortable, and well-furnished.  It was always nice to come ""home"" to during our five-night stay.  Terry was polite and always available by phone to answer questions.  The neighborhood was quiet, and we felt safe.  As others have noted, the metal spiral stairs to the bedroom downstairs are a bit tight, but it wasn't much of an issue for us.  Highly recommended!  "
6695,1600195,2012-07-01,1548872,Burkhard,"Terry's home was very clean and the furnishing was very thought thru and well equipped. There was plenty of material such as maps and broshures.
<br/>The apartment is right near the T station Roxbury crossing and from there it is just a matter of minutes to get right into the center of Boston. 
<br/>The communication with Terry worked very well. He answered our emails right away. 
<br/>We certainly do recommend the apartment to other guests. "
6695,2570960,2012-10-10,3165379,Melody,Apartment was well appointed and nicely furnished.  It's within walking distance of transit and not more than a 15 minute drive to local attractions. Would highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting the Boston area. 
6695,2632123,2012-10-16,3322916,Neil,Terry was a great host and very accessible.  The apartment was fabulous and had all the amenities I could ask for.  The location right by the T crossing allowed us easy access to the city.  Overall I was really pleased with my stay and would highly recommend staying there. 
6695,4393715,2013-05-02,1781034,David,"This was my first trip to Boston, so I took a bit of a shot with this listing because I didn't know the neighborhoods or lay of the land at all. But the location turned out to be perfect - I lucked out. You will be roughly the equivalent of three city blocks from the T (Orange line Roxbury Crossing) if you cut through Roxbury Community College campus. From there, you're two stops from Mass Ave and Tremont and a short walk to trendy South End, or hop on the #1 bus and be on Newbury in 10 minutes. Go one more stop to Back Bay and your in Copley Square or Boston Commons The apt itself, is beautiful. It's quiet, handy, full of amenities, and Terry could not have been more courteous and helpful. I rented a car for a couple day-trips and parking on Centre Street was a breeze, and it was a quick shot east to I-93 with easy access to the cape, beaches, airport, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Maine. I had a perfect vacation, due largely to the fact that I had a great and convenient place to stay. Thanks Terry!!"
6695,4446364,2013-05-06,2723495,Elizabeth & Dan,"The Fort Hill Inn was remarkably convenient and comfortable! With the quiet surroundings and plush bed I got the best sleep ever on a Boston trip. Don't need earplugs to sleep here! Our guest who used the sofa bed had no complaints either. 
<br/>We were so busy we did not have a chance to use the well equipped kitchen.The coffee from Butterfly Coffee/Cafe at Roxbury Crossing was so good! No decaf at Butterfly but coffee very smooth nonetheless. 
<br/>The ""Hubway"" positioned right at the T station made it super convenient to rent a bike and see the city. Just remember to check that bike in every 30 minutes to a Hubway bike stand. We biked along the Charles and over to Old Ironsides in Charlestown to be tourists and then back. Biked over to Newbury Street for dinner at Stephanie's later that evening. Absolutely exhilarating and such fun!
<br/>Had a mechanical problem with a door lock that Terry took care of immediately much to our relief. Terry is very responsive and we felt we were in good hands.
<br/>"
6695,5362265,2013-06-26,1559119,Alison,"Absolutely wonderful stay! Very convenient location, very close to the T. The apartment is lovely. Terry has shown so much attention to detail. Check in and check out was super easy. I would highly recommend to anyone staying in Boston for business or travel. Thanks Terry!"
6695,6734665,2013-08-23,294553,Renee,"I was a bit nervous about staying here due to reviews about safety. Rest assured, this area is super safe. Do not take a cab here. Cab drivers only know downtown. Take the T, its cheaper and easier. Terry greeted us and broke down the area for us. We love the layout of the apartment.  Our only hiccup was the shower as the temperature was all over the place but that's wasn't a big deal to us as we live in NYC and in our apts the same thing can happen.  Plan to eat at The Squealing Pig in Mission Hill it has a great vibe and food. For most of the trip, plan to eat the Back Bay Area as there are some great places around the house but not as many options as we New Yorkers are use to. We had the run of the second apartment and very much enjoyed our stay. If you have any questions, Terry is a text away. We would return to The Fort Hill Inn in any future visits to the area. "
6695,6945890,2013-08-31,7193987,Wayne,"I stayed at the Fort Hill Inn from August 26th to August<br/>29th,2013. Terry the host was great. He was there when I<br/>Arrived to check me in. The check in was easy. Terry helped me bring my luggage to the apartment. The place <br/>Was squeaky clean! The kitchen and bathroom was immaculate ! I really enjoyed staying here! The T is just a 5 minute walk away from the Inn. I parked my car on the street for 3 days. The neighborhood Is very safe and welcoming . I would definitely stay here again the next <br/>Time I visit Boston! Good job Terry and thank you for making my visit a pleasant experience!"
6695,7293955,2013-09-14,691286,J.D.,"In afraid to write too positive of a review because I want this secret to remain mine! Terry has a fantastic duplex that made me fall back in love with the red-brick hamlet that Boston can so often be. Great place, great host and no problem with parking. I WILL be back! "
6695,8447974,2013-10-31,2895852,Joanie,"Bar none, the best accommodations I have experienced on AirBnb!
<br/>Beautifully furnished, thoughtfully appointed, it covered everything.  Terri has a great eye, which makes for a more comfortable stay.  He has thought of EVERYTHING, from offering not-run-of-the-mill guides (even a large, laminated map of Boston tastefully set on the coffee table; great for easier planning), to a fully stocked bathroom that was better planned than I was for this trip!  He was kind and courteous, greeting me to make sure I had everything I needed after checking in.  This is how attentive he is; when I answered the door with my coat still on, he checked in to make sure the apartment was too cold (it wasn't.). 
<br/>
<br/>A good host pays attention to the details!
<br/>
<br/>Incredibly convenient, Terri's place is a leisurely 3-5 minute walk to public transportation.  Area layout:  T station, Community College directly across the street, then Terri's place behind that.  That easy! 
<br/>
<br/>Being that there is a police station within visible distance of the block, always an extra assurance to a traveler.  A few minutes in any direction will take you to some great museums (Isabella Stewart Gardner!), pubs, architecturally gorgeous churches.  What a nice suburban insight, off the beaten path.  Terri's neighborhood is beautiful and friendly.
<br/>
<br/>You can't go wrong with Terri's place.  It's your home away from home, maybe even a little bit better.  Incredible deal and value for such luxury.  Why pay the same price for some generic chain that is the same in Oklahoma, Washington, or Ohio?  Go for something more memorable and personal.  :)"
6695,9103225,2013-12-07,4586728,Hilary,"Convenient to the T and in a quiet little cul-de-sac. There was always a place to park, too.  Comfortable furnishings and the kitchen had what we needed to cook some food for ourselves (pots, pans, etc.).  We were there for work and didn't have much free time in the neighborhood but we did take a walk up to the park at the top of the hill and it was very scenic - William Lloyd Garrison's house was on the way back!  Will definitely be back for our next trip!"
6695,9563204,2014-01-02,8216115,Ian,"Terry's apartment is beautifully renovated and decorated.  It was very comfortable and homey, and it was great to have such a nice kitchen to make a meal.  We could not have been more satisfied or more warmly welcomed."
6695,10038920,2014-01-27,5033243,Ryan,"Friend and I really enjoyed our time at Terry's apartment! He was very easy to reach and flexible, would definitely stay here again next time I am in Boston, thanks Terry!"
6695,11502492,2014-04-05,13754082,Cari,We had a wonderful stay at Terry's condo.  It is beautifully decorated and comfortable and spacious!  It's on a quiet little street and close to a Transit hub.  The kitchen is fully stocked and there are lots of extra blankets and towels.  This was my first experience with AirBNB and I can't wait to use it again in the future!
6695,12568849,2014-05-05,14270540,Julia,"The place was great and Terry was very nice, highly recommended. 
<br/>"
6695,13339566,2014-05-26,476856,Francis,"Terry was an excellent host responding promptly to all enquiries before and after our booking.  We actually only met him very briefly during our stay as we were out a lot. 
<br/>
<br/>The fact that we only met him this once is a testament to the effective arrangements he has in place for checking in and checking out. Also, we found everything in the apartment was in working order therefore there was no need to trouble him.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment was as described in the listing and in excellent shape with clear instructions on various matters. Strong Wi-Fi signal was available.
<br/>
<br/>The neighborhood was fine. It was fairly quiet and we always felt safe. The Roxbury Crossing ‘T’ station is a short 4 to 5 minute walk away and with trains every 10 minutes or so you are downtown in no time at all (10 minute ride to Downtown Crossing). 
<br/>
<br/>If you are staying for more than a couple of days an $18 MBTA weekly pass is excellent value as it includes trains, buses and the inner harbor water taxi. It is also very easy to travel to/from the airport using the ‘T’ (approx. 40 min) saving on expensive taxis/ shuttles.
<br/>
<br/>Cannot comment on local shopping, as we tended to bring in groceries from the excellent Wholefoods Market in downtown Boston.
<br/>
<br/>We had a great time in Boston and if we return to the city we would be delighted to stay at Terry’s place again.  
<br/>"
6695,13953399,2014-06-09,13606185,Natalie,Terry was quick to respond to all messages.  We did not have any interaction with Terry while we were in town but I have no doubt that he would have responded quickly if we needed anything.  As a testament to his wonderful planning his apartment was easily found based on his directions.  A quick walk from the T.  We did not rent a car while in Boston as the public transportation was so easy to manage and so close to the condo.  There were tons of information regarding tourist spots in the condo in case you want to look for additional places to go.  Wifi was great along with the cable tv.  We did not make use of the kitchen but it was nicely equipped.  Terry's condo was approximately half the price of a hotel during the time period we stayed and we had MORE room than a hotel.  Very comfortable furnishings.  This being our first airbnb experience has made us look further into using this service for future trips.
6695,15629043,2014-07-13,5431675,Ariane,"I stayed at Terry's with 3 other people and the apartment was spacious enough, clean, cozy, and very. Terry was very quick to respond prior to arrival and when needed something (just a toilet paper refill) during our week long stay. This apartment  offers everything needed in a great location, close to subway station, with free parking available. As described and I highly recommend it! "
6695,17064904,2014-08-06,15435912,Lynne,"Terry was a great host, extremely accommodating and lovely to deal with. He met us on check in and left us with maps and recommendations of things to do, see and restaurants to go to in Boston. 
<br/>
<br/>Only a 5min walk to the T (subway) and 15mins into the centre of Boston.  The apartment was nicely furnished and had everything that we needed - we would definitely stay here again."
6695,17454544,2014-08-12,17783368,Kevin,Quel endroit parfait! Nous avons eu l'impression de vivre comme de vrai Bostoniens. L'emplacement très près du T a grandement facilité nos déplacements et nous y reviendront lors de notre prochain passage à Boston. Terry est très accueillant et l'appartement était parfait sous tout point de vue. 
6695,18882761,2014-09-02,14341456,Monica,"We had a very pleasent stay.
<br/>The apartment was in excellent condition, very comfortable, spacious and very clean. The apartment that shows the photos is not the same as that which we arrived. The bedroom and the bathroom are in the basement, where the noise of the air conditioning was noted. 
<br/>In the apartment there are maps of the city and tourist information.
<br/>WIFI works very good.
<br/>The neighborhood: it is very quiet. We had a car, and found enough space to park free. We used it every day, especially to avoid the night walk from the subway station to the house, the trip is not long but it is lonely.
<br/>Terry: received us on arrival, very friendly and helpful. We only bothered him to help us open the suitcase because we had lost the key to the lock and he solved the issue very efficiently. The rest of the time we communicate by email"
6695,19130097,2014-09-07,14252773,Chun,"It is a really nice apartment. We love it very much. The only problem is the bedroom is underground, it is not easy to get into."
6695,19593709,2014-09-15,4743495,Maryse,"Mande un mensaje a Terry informándole de que íbamos a llegar antes de la hora prevista y
<br/> se mostró conciliador y permitiéndonos dejar nuestras maletas, al final la limpieza estaba acabada y pudimos instalarnos. Apreciamos la flexibilidad y la buena disposición. Terry nos acogió con mucha amabilidad y nos proporciono información interesante sobre Boston. La casa se correspondía al anuncio, muy limpia, acogedora y con sensación de hogar. Nos sentimos muy a gusto. Las comunicaciones con la T son cercanas y rápidas.
<br/>Sin embargo creo necesario añadir que la zona puede parecer algo insegura, advertencia que nos hizo el taxista que nos llevo allí. No tuvimos ninguna mala experiencia pero sí uno es sensible con este tema esto no es una buena opción."
6695,21337368,2014-10-15,5274836,Gabriela,"This is a great place to stay in Boston! Well furnitured, clean, full kitchen with all you can need... This place is about just a 5 min walk to a metro station. And Terry is the best host you can ever met! Attentious, answered us very quick, helpful...
<br/>This definitly is a place in Boston that we will stay again! Thanks Terry for everything! You are just great!"
6695,21855499,2014-10-25,15872528,Seunghee,It's a beautiful & clean classic house. I was very satisfied with the place and host. 
6695,28106699,2015-03-17,26593991,Trang,"Listing was very accurate. Terry was very informative and he answered all my questions during my stay very quickly. The place was clean, cute and very homy. The kitchen was fully supplied. The place was however very cold at night. "
6695,51724950,2015-10-24,43132177,Jan,Apartment was as shown and quite comfortable. Appreciated Terry's flexibility with our arrival and departure times. 
6695,58187688,2016-01-01,19708799,François,"Excellent séjour. Super accueil. Appartement très bien situé , beau et très propre. Merci beaucoup pour le séjour "
6695,64232426,2016-03-01,12041421,Anne,"Loved the way this place was decorated!  Lots of warm, inviting color, very comfortable bed.  Easy walk up to second floor.  Residential neighborhood, quiet, easy parking on street nearby.  Would stay again."
6695,71347850,2016-04-24,18601159,Jennifer,"The Fort Hill Inn was a very nicely renovated brick row house on a tiny dead end side street.  The immediate neighborhood felt very safe, had close access to the T, and best of all had easy access to free parking, as we had traveled to Boston in 2 cars.  The delightful host Terry was in and out of the property (I believe he lives upstairs) and was available to assist us in anything we needed--including recommending an auto service shop as we encountered some car trouble on our travels.  Plenty of maps and Boston guides as well as some Uber coupons left for us on the mantel.  We felt so comfortable and at home in the beautifully decorated apartment--an eclectic mix of old, thrift, fancy and useful-- Terry has a great eye for what you would expect to find in this kind of building! Plus the kitchen was well stocked with essential items for cooking.  Although we had a car with us, we preferred using the T and Uber during our stay so we didn't have to deal with driving headaches in downtown Boston.  The location of this apartment made that easy and economical.  We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay at this place and will definitely stay here again when we come back to Boston!!"
6695,76357016,2016-05-26,22345610,Luis,"This was just as advertised!  I thought the location was almost perfect. Not too close to the tourist area but not too far. If you plan on using this location and have a vehicle, be aware that Tueday mornings is tricky. Streets are cleaned between 8-12 so make plans to leave before 8.  I couldn't easily find a place to park and I ended up getting a parking ticket. <br/>The unit itself was awesome. Very home like and clean. Would definitely recommend."
6695,112902390,2016-11-08,18499858,Samuel,"Terry was very quick to help set up when our booking feel thru.  Great response time, and terrific apartment "
6695,113746370,2016-11-13,97034863,Donald,"Terry was very nice when we met him. The place was nice, clean and well maintained upon arrival. Would definitely stay there again. This was our first Airbnb experience and it was very enjoyable. Thanks!"
6695,115690279,2016-11-26,101278936,Guinn,This was our first Airbnb experience and it was great! Terry's place is so charming! I highly recommend it!
6695,116661456,2016-12-02,58301241,Hanhee,Terry는 집에 들어가는 방법이나 위치에 대해서 명확하게 잘 설명해 주었고 숙소를 사용하는 동안에도 빠르게 답장을 해주거나 저희가 필요한 것들을 바로바로 가져다 주었습니다. 전반적으로 아주 만족합니다. 다만 소파를 침대로 써야하는데 여기서 잘 때 조금 춥습니다.
6695,123731158,2016-12-30,63335509,Angelica,"This apartment is gorgeous. The location is about a 3 minute walk from the nearest T station and walking there after dark was fine. The inside is clean, we'll designed and most of all extremely comfortable. The only thing is to get downstairs to the bedroom there is a spiral staircase that was a little narrow- if you have any type of physical challenges I would keep this in mind but there is also a sofa bed on the first floor. Two televisions, nice hot water and a kitchen well equipped. We enjoyed our stay!"
6695,141545663,2017-04-03,26527219,Mary,"I booked the 1br/2 bed unit for Friday through Monday morning. The only issue was that when we arrived late on Friday night there was a couple and their 2 children in our room. Turns out they entered our rental by mistake. They had booked an efficiency across the street. It was a little inconvenient to get there and have this happen, but I commend Terry for taking my call at 11:30pm and addressing it. We ended up in the smaller space across the street and Terry refunded us $100 for the trouble. Other than that, the apartment was very charming and comfortable. The location is convenient and there seemed to be ample parking on the streets nearby. Terry was very responsive from the initial booking until the end of our trip. I would book this place again. "
6695,142902513,2017-04-09,884311,Yousuf,"Terry's place was perfect.  Exactly as it is advertised, a beautiful apartment with a comfortable sleeper sofa and a bed downstairs.  The bathroom was very clean, and the host Terry was very kind and gave us a lot of privacy.  It is located on a small side street so it is very quiet, but still extremely close to the T, and even walkable to downtown Boston and the convention center. I'd definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting Boston."
6695,148001861,2017-04-29,4747692,Fouad,"This place is magical and truly takes you away from the stress of everyday. Also, it is very clean and location is great. Terry never sleeps and always answered at anytime of the day. Easy check in/check out. I checked it at 1AM and Terry still was awake and answered my messages. Amazing"
6695,153998991,2017-05-22,11277830,Shelley,Beautiful place! Very nicely decorated and spacious. Short walk to transit. Keep in mind if you have any mobility issues you will find it very difficult to use the narrow spiral wrought iron stair case to the lower level where the bedroom is. We have no issue. Great kitchen and bathroom. Easy check in
6695,188507510,2017-08-29,128582325,Angel,"Terry is a good host - always there to answer your call.<br/>The apartment itself is pretty clean and well kept, but it is also old and a bit worn... but hey... that's Boston. We were not prepared for how small it is, but that wasn't too much of an issue. With two girls though, we found that there was no place to lay out our things in the bathroom, so in that respect, I guess the size was an annoyance.<br/>My daughter loved the charm of the spiral staircase but we both found it hard to navigate. You definitely can’t get up and down it easily if you are carrying things in your hands, so if you are considering a stay, just know that it will be difficult to carry items such as small suitcases or stacks of bedding from upstairs to downstairs and back again.<br/>The downstairs bed for us was not too comfortable – could be a bonus though for those who prefer a hard mattress.<br/>It's a little hard to figure out which exterior door to enter if it's nighttime when you first arrive – some are marked with silver numbers/letters but others have been painted over in a dark brown and can't be seen in the dark.<br/>We stayed in August and there was a LOT of early morning noise from construction and birds… It was actually impossible for me to sleep in. Between the clanging and loud motors of construction vehicles, workers yelling, and the incessant bird calls, I was up at 7 am whether I wanted to be or not (I didn’t!)… so was exhausted by the end of the trip. But if you're a sound sleeper, this won't bother you. (My daughter slept right through it.)<br/>The street itself is a challenge; Uber/Lyft drivers can’t turn around if they drop you or pick you up at the door… they have to back up all the way to the top of the block and maneuver backwards into traffic.<br/>Lastly, a couple of blocks away when walking, you find yourself in a pretty sketchy neighborhood, which we were not prepared for. But to be fair, we had never been to Boston before, so this was a learning experience. <br/>Regardless of the size, noise, and location, be assured that the apartment is  delightfully and tastefully appointed. The decor is what attracted us to begin with, and it did not disappoint. The owner has lovely taste."
6695,197945423,2017-09-27,130805992,Tyler,House is clean and in a good neighbourhood. Really enjoyed our stay.
6695,201115043,2017-10-07,127747161,Faith,"My friends and I had such a wonderful experience on our trip.  Terry was extremely quick to respond whenever I had a question. He was also very flexible with allowing us a slightly later check-out time due to our later departure from Boston Logan.  His home is a short 5 min walk from the train/bus station, and we never had issues obtaining an Uber/Lyft from that location. His home was very clean, very well decorated, there were basic supplies in the kitchen if you needed to cook (or open a bottle of wine!), we had plenty of fresh towels, complimentary bathroom toiletries and extra pillows. He also provided a nice map and guide to Boston which was appreciated. I highly recommend this location if you're in town for vacation or work, and the convenience to the train station was very helpful!"
6695,207173321,2017-10-28,143922805,Jennifer,"A lovely apartment in a nice area of town. It is located outside of the city core, but only a short subway ride away. I felt very safe there, and it was about a 5 minute walk away from the Roxbury Crossing station. The apartment was a good size, and the kitchen had all the amenities that we could have wanted. Nicely decorated and quiet, except for some construction noise around the community college occasionally. We used both the downstairs bedroom and the pull-out couch. Both were comfortable. We appreciated the maps and tourism info. There was lots of street parking in the area. Would definitely stay there again. Thank you Terry."
6695,213347581,2017-11-20,153021762,Lauren,This is a great apartment close to the T and easy Uber or Lyft rides around town. It’s a very ethnically diverse neighborhood. Lots of space and amenities. One head’s up is the spiral staircase down to the bedroom. Anyone of larger size/weight or not of good physical ability might find that challenging
6695,217958081,2017-12-10,160668947,Jeffery,This place was great. It was warm and bright. It's only a few blocks from the orange line and the train can get you pretty much anywhere in Boston. The beds were comfy and the decor was welcoming. There's a mosque and a cathedral within walking distance. Also Dunkin donuts is pretty close by. All in all a nice location and a comfortable home.

The mattress and bedding is very comfortable and clean and slept very well. The living room and kitchen are very comfortable and had everything needed for a short or long term stay.

The check-in instructions were perfect, every room was spotless and there were sight seeing tips included in the apartment. The location is not far from a T stop and walking distance to Northeastern University. We parked the car around the corner and by walking, taking the T and Uber, didn't move it until we left. Recommended!"
6695,323050833,2018-09-14,35011114,Santino,Terry is an amazing host. He replies quickly to questions and he is very accessible whether you are using the app or texting him directly.

6695,335555055,2018-10-12,4657421,Jasmin,"We were traveling as a couple; Terry’s place was perfect for our short stay in Boston. It looks exactly like in the pictures. It’s an open kitchen, the couch is super comfy as is the bed. The apartment is lovely decorated with many little details. It’s in a residential area with the subway just a couple of walking minutes away and a really short ride into the city. We’d definitely come again!"
6695,337183999,2018-10-15,189374193,Mortimer,Adorable petit appartement décoré avec style et goût dans quartier calme à l’ouest. Hôte réactif et prévenant. Recommandé même si le seul point négatif est le manque de privacy à cause des vis-à-vis des deux côtés.

We explored and tried several options In The guestbook such as Penguin Pizza and Asher’s restaurant. Both were delicious. You will need to be familiar with Uber but cost is minimal. Definitely recommend.

6695,468048750,2019-06-11,68521820,Shelby,"We absolutely loved staying at Terry’s place.  He provided everything you could need, including detergent for the washer and dryer.  The apartment is in a safe neighborhood a short walk from public transportation.  Everything is perfectly set up and clean!!!   I would definitely stay there again if visiting Boston. <br/>My only caution ... there is a winding metal spiral staircase to access the bedroom.  If you have an elderly family member or a toddler, this may not work for you.  It wasn’t the main stairway we saw in the pictures.  It was fine for us, but just giving you a heads up.  <br/>Terry was great and we really loved our stay."
6695,469387521,2019-06-14,260493060,Brianna,Great place! Convenient location.  Very clean and organized. Had a minor issue with the toilet but was fixed as soon as we notified them. I would highly recommend this place for anyone touring Boston.
6695,472385515,2019-06-19,201455577,Marcy Ellen Elly,"Appliances new and good counter space . Couch and chairs upper space comfortable. Lower level was damp as it is what I consider to be basement level. Efforts made to decorate nicely and it is. The home as entering does have an old home smell , however, which triggered my allergies as did the lower level high humidity levels. I was just there to be at apt very early and arrived late . For those without allergies and wanting great kitchen facilities at reasonable price it is a great option. It is however a bit of a walk to the T. I used uber because of time constraints which worked out fine. Parking was no problem. <br/>I will say I was confused ,after booking on ABNB ,which room I booked after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and VRBO and seeing a different name listed on Google Maps when I plugged in address... I needed clarification from owners . Responded to my several texts right away. Good option for Boston vacationers as hotel prices have skyrocketed."
6695,474839869,2019-06-23,44172948,Trisha,This was a beautifully done space close to the T line of Roxberry Crossing. It was a great value for a very nice space to stay.

6695,504965532,2019-08-08,130322486,John,"The place was amazing. The location was perfect. Whenever I had a question, I received a timely response. Completed the freedom trail, saw a baseball game, took a tour of Sam Adams Brewery, the Basilica of the Lady of Perpetual Hope, the NE aquarium, the Franklin Park Zoo, discovered a delightful little place called Milkweed and explored the area in 2 1/2 days. Very happy about the outcome. I would recommend to a family member."

6695,558160561,2019-11-02,73969100,Sandy,"Fort Hill Inn was perfect for our time in Boston.  It's a 5 min walk to the orange line so we could go everywhere without a car.  The apartment was lovely with a great living room, kitchen, and a bedroom down a spiral staircase.  The rooms very clean, you can tell the owners take pride in their place.  Loved that it also had free wifi - important as I needed to stay in touch with work.  The neighborhood was very quiet.  Restaurants and grocery store are a 15-20 min walk.  Next time we are in Boston, we will definitely look for availability at Terry's place."

6695,743494732281168364,2022-10-22,249975585,Erika,"We loved the Fort Hill Inn! It was exactly as described, and CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN! Very quaintly decorated, and the hosts thought of every single thing you might need for your stay. It isn't in the best area, but we still felt safe, and it was a short walk to the T station. Walking back is a little challenging bcause it is up a steep hill, but shouldn't be a problem for most people. The hosts were very communicative and helpful. I would definitely stay here again!"

6695,1012305777512008126,2023-10-28,29816123,Tessa,"Terry’s place has high quality furnishings and is kitted out very well. We had everything we needed to cook at home and there is oil/salt/spices available in the kitchen. Take note, if you do plan on cooking at home, the closest grocery store is about 1km away, but it is huge. Good quality towels and piping hot water in the shower. It is wonderfully quiet at night, if you are a light sleeper :-) A 10min walk from the Roxbury T station, and probably 20mins train ride to the city.<br/>Terry was very helpful and and quick to replace the high dryer that wasn’t working. We used the washing machine and dryer in the basement and it was easy to operate and worked very well.<br/>I would definitely recommend this place."

We highly recommend staying in this area...close to historical sites and the beautiful Boston Commons park, with easy access to the T.

<br/>"
8789,44309281,2015-08-25,3643448,Oleg,"We stayed at Anne's place for 5 nights. Ideally located for everything in Boston. Close to Boston Common, the Theater District, Long Wharf and shops. Anne was very helpful, she gave us a brief introduction to the neighborhood. The apt. is clean and stylish: good to know there's access to the 10th floor rooftop terrace with great views, even of Charles River. Very safe and really nice concierges in the lobby. Thanks, Anne!"
8789,55341485,2015-12-01,34304245,Dagmar,"The flat is within a large well-managed building block with a very friendly reception. All interactions with the landlady, Anne, were very easy: Anne was highly responsive throughout. The heating situation in the flat is not ideal: it was cold at the begin of Autumn and rather warm and dry later  with no chance to regulate the temperature from within the flat other than by opening a single window that is not locked. The kitchen was equipped with everything I needed - a hairdryer in the bathroom would have been nice. The location of the flat is fantastic with everything in Boston in easy reach: was very happy there. Regarding the flat itself, it is a little bit more ""run-down"" than it looks on the photos, but overall very nice and charming. Washing machines are down the hallway and can be operated with either 7(!) quarters or a credit card..."
8789,61550046,2016-02-06,22661790,Celius Antonio,"We stayed at Anne's place on the whole month of January/2016, and we had a great time there.

<br/>The information is very accurate and I want to say that the location is superb!.We have everything we needed to cook meals,relaxed after our outings in a very comfortable living area or indulge ourselves with the views from the top roof.
<br/>The best thing about this venue is the location.It is also  safe and secure.
<br/>Thank you Anne!.

8789,71079777,2016-04-23,57430992,Virginie,"Anne was really super nice and welcoming to us. We had everything we needed to feel at home during the week we were in Boston. The appartment really looks like the description. The situation in a quite calm street but near everything is perfect to discover Boston by foot and public transportation. As said by other guests, the rooftop is really great to look at the sunset above the town. There's a lot of light and place in the livingroom and the kitchen has what you need to cook when you don't want to go to the restaurant."
8789,248439418,2018-03-31,161021623,Graham,Great location. Close to public transportation and tons of things to do in the area. Anne was easy to reach and quick to respond to any needs I had.
8789,281276341,2018-06-24,8865264,Roei,"I stayed in the apartment for three weeks and had a very good experience. The location is superb, next to the state house and a short distance from Boston Common and Park subway station. The apartment was clean, and excellently equipped with basics, sheets, towels, and even foodstuffs and cleaning supplies. While the apartment is very well maintained, some of the infrastructure is nevertheless not very new (e.g., the A/C is old and very noisy, and some furniture were shaky or of low quality). Anne was remarkably professional and considerate, and communicated quickly to solve problems. For example, when things needed fixing (e.g., a light was broken, or there was a leakage from the apartment upstairs) Anne acted immediately to fix them; or, when Anne wanted to show the apartment to another agent, but learned that I was somewhat uncomfortable with it, she promptly cancelled the plan. One last thing to note is that the apartment has big windows with lots of natural light (that is not blocked by the semi-transparent curtains)."
8789,302996288,2018-08-06,1865364,Kathryn,This a a fantastic spot right on Boston Commons Park. Next to the beautiful State building. Beautiful marble lobby. Helpful concierge and Anne is always quick to respond. 
8789,314969596,2018-08-27,2105155,Pam,Get location! Very comfortable bed and  adequate space! Street noise can be loud at times but I slept through it all!
8789,322252190,2018-09-12,50244767,Joseph,"This is a beautiful place in an unbelievable location.  The center of the city is right out your door.<br/>Anne was incredibly helpful and communicative.<br/>Highly recommend this place, top notch."
8789,337823302,2018-10-17,34906132,Philippe,"logement exceptionnellement bien situé , mais très bruyant du fait de la vétusté des fenêtres"
8789,341310209,2018-10-26,122320958,Krista,The location is excellent and the apartment had everything you might need.  Surprisingly quiet for being in the heart of the city.  Comfortable and clean.  Anne is an excellent host and  responds quickly.  Would definitely stay again.
8789,360421503,2018-12-20,225008023,Chris,"Outstanding location-close to red line (3 minute walk), short walk to major shopping (downtown crossing) and seconds from several restaurants, pubs, and historic sites.  The apartment was well-furnished, clean and comfortable.  Anne was an amazing host--she responded to emails or texts within minutes and was very helpful--recommending dining sites, other suggestions on shopping/amenities in the area, and help on the basics of the apartment (note to future renters--the on/off switch to the heater is inside the box next to the kitchen under the lid on the right--you may need to use the flashlight feature on the phone to find the switch!). I stayed in the unit for an extended stay (~3 weeks) and it was quite comfortable and felt like home. Thanks Anne!"
8789,461474178,2019-05-31,235709783,Peter,"I stayed here for four months on business travel and really enjoyed my stay. The location is unbeatable, and Anne is a great host."
8789,539001694,2019-09-30,272021191,Mark,"Anne is a pleasure to work with. She is as responsive as one can be, and very helpful.  The apartment was just as advertised. Very clean. Bed was comfortable. I stayed in September so had windows open much of the days....the curved glass allowed great airflow and comfort throughout apartment. <br/>Great stay. I will contact Anne for my next stay in Boston."
8789,622465617,2020-04-15,71915398,Kelsey,Great location! Super convenient. Will stay again
8789,889862055790017067,2023-05-12,251407041,Junho,Great view and cozy apartment. Something to note temperature is not controllable but a space heater is provided.
8789,970289579842846806,2023-08-31,61665312,Nicolas,Great location and the rooftop view is incredible. Was a very pleasant stay here!
8789,1050839712170962572,2023-12-20,286650,John And Nina,"Staying here was absolutely amazing. I went to college right down the street and I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay! It was in a great area, easily walkable, super great place. Right near all major T-stops so it was easy to get anywhere I wanted to go. Beautiful view with a lot of sunlight.<br/>Anne was a wonderful host, always willing to help out if I ever needed it. If you're a student or just someone looking for a great place to stay in Boston I would absolutely recommend this place!"
8789,1157287973863628953,2024-05-15,522296329,Aizhan,Нам очень понравилась квартира. Отличное расположение в центре Бостона. Спасибо Anne
10811,59324269,2016-01-09,5297851,Kelly,"Loved it!!  this place is absolutely gorgeous and very spacious for a studio.  Amazing neighborhood, everything is in walking distance.  Michelle is very nice and very responsive to inquiries and it was a very easy transition in arrival.  "
10811,68636139,2016-04-05,4130561,Dana,"The check in process could have been a lot smoother, and the bed was about as comfortable as can be expected for a Murphy bed (not listed as such). I'm also a pretty light sleeper and was woken up several times by the upstairs neighbors' footsteps. Great location but disappointing for the price. "
10811,77559826,2016-06-01,26482906,Carol,"This apartment is a little gem. Its Back Bay location was handy for nearly everything we wanted to do. The little kitchen was well equipped, no oven, but a useful dishwasher. The apartment was nicely furnished and clean. The shower worked well. We would gladly stay here again the next time we are in Boston. There are loads of restaurants and a very good Star Market nearby. The Boston Women's  Memorial is also near."
10811,115075407,2016-11-21,1698101,Mirjam,Communicating with Michelle is very easy. The brown stone is incredibly beautiful and  the location is perfect! Would recommend it to city dwellers anytime!
10811,138615855,2017-03-20,52784351,Mary,"Nice apartment, close to the train, Michelle was very helpful when we had questions"
10811,142514593,2017-04-08,859878,Calvin,"Michelle's studio is very nicely located within walking distance of major Boston destinations, both touristy and business-oriented. The street is in Back Bay, but is quiet and filled with lovely brownstones and quaint streetlamps. I particularly appreciated how close it was to the Hynes Convention Center and to Newbury St, which had lots of nice places to eat or get a coffee.<br/>My only complaints (which are mostly minor!) were with the studio. I arrived to find the iron out of order, which I had been hoping to rely on to look good for my conference. And this may not bother some travelers, but it was difficult to get any internet-based work done, as the wifi was very slow. <br/>In general the studio does have some elements that appear worn around the edges, but if you're looking for a value for the location, it's a good stay!"
10811,330572658,2018-09-30,205562969,María Cecilia,"La ubicación excelente, el departamento más pequeño de lo que reflejan las fotos, una zona muy complicada para estacionar y sobre esto no fue clara Michelle cuando le requerí sobre el tema específicamente"
10811,477092921,2019-06-27,43805682,Adrienne,The location is amazing. You can walk to the Corner Tavern and to different parks. You’re in the center of a lot! No need to rent a car if you stay here. I totally recommend this place. The only downside was no oven but who has time for that anyway on vacation.
10811,493462927,2019-07-22,18683737,Friederike,Great location!
10813,425161559,2019-03-17,157035756,Ingrid,Michelle’s place was fabulous! Clean and had everything we needed. The location was spectacular!
10813,473998654,2019-06-22,155909584,Robert,Very nice place
10813,480403503,2019-07-02,108828528,Shannon,"Amazing location, Murphy bed was comfortable and the kitchen was great. Also a plus the water pressure was fantastic for an older home. Quiet neighborhood and a great walking neighborhood."
10813,713005238,2020-12-02,70812706,Ken,"What a great location!!!  Boston is my favorite city in the U.S. (I live there for 20 years), the Back Bay is my favorite neighborhood, and this studio is on my favorite street.   I feel lucky to have stayed there.  This is a very quiet street.  Very little traffic. You step outside, and it's like you are in an upscale urban 19th century London neighborhood.  (Well, ok, except for all the parked cars haha.)  You hear birds.   You are surrounded by trees.  And these charming townhouses.  Old but well kept up.  You  are a very short walk to the Charles River, shopping, and public transportation.  I recommend walking the Commonwealth Avenue Mall (they call it a ""Mall"" -  it's just an exceptionally beautiful median strip) to the Public Gardens.<br/>The studio itself has high ceilings, bay windows, a decorative fireplace, and a certain old world charm.<br/>Michelle was an excellent hostess. I had a few problems - with cable TV, with wifi, and with the stovetop - but she addressed them promptly.  She even had a brand new stovetop installed.<br/>One more recommendation: Check out the very good bike sharing system, called ""BlueBikes"", and pedal around the Charles."
10813,1028373932250621909,2023-11-19,478718098,Andrew,Michelle was very helpful with the booking and accommodating. Thank you very much for contributing to such a pleasant stay.
10986,1062347069958986192,2024-01-05,91504025,Isabel,Decent stay
18711,41856,2010-05-12,104064,Tanya,"Awesome experience.  Great place, close to everything.  Apartment was in excellent condition, and most enjoyable.  Thanks for a lovely time in Boston!"
18711,48734,2010-06-01,89310,Debi,"Great place to stay in Boston - plenty of space and a really nice environment. Lovely restaurant next door. 10 minute walk to the T, and there are shuttles to the airport available for $5 from local hotels. A hairdryer would have been nice.
<br/>
<br/>Thoroughly recommended"
18711,70408,2010-07-29,91247,Amy,"We stayed in the Penthouse in Boston. The house was GREAT and we thoroughly enjoyed our week's stay. Check-in/out was very simple and convenient for when we got in to town and decided to leave.
<br/>
<br/>The location itself is about a half mile walk from the nearest T station so if you don't mind walking, it wasn't a big deal for us.
<br/>
<br/>Probably the only thing we would have liked to see was actually a sheet set available for the pull out couch or air mattress used during our stay. There was a thin comforter for the couch and a couple random blankets we used and made due with, but if we had any more people there or were really picky it would have been nice to be furnished with a real set.
<br/>
<br/>Lance was great in responding to us as we had a couple questions while we were there and he was able to help us out.
<br/>
<br/>Would definitely recommend a stay here!"
18711,118858,2010-10-14,201485,Bonnie,"Check in and check out was very easy.  We stayed in The Penthouse, and it was very enjoyable.  There is a balcony that gives a really night view of the city of Boston, and the apartment is very clean and comfortable for a family.  My son from England joined me here, as well as my daughter from California.  We all enjoyed it.  The neighborhood is being renovated, and public transportation, either bus or subway, are both near. We would stay here again, if in Boston.  The only drawback is that you have to walk up four flights to get to The Penthouse, which was no problem for my son or daughter but for a 67 year old with arthritis of the knees proved to be a task. "
18711,297982,2011-06-05,347925,Roderick,"Wow what a great place to stay, very convenient to public transport. Beautiful apartment, well appointed with everything we needed including a good restaurant next door. We found Lance to be a warm and receptive host. Highly recommended. "
18711,328453,2011-06-22,594225,Kristjan,"The Dorset was great! We were four that stayed in the apartment - two couples and we had a great time. The location was very good and we had everything we needed in the apartment. I recommend the Dorset - especially if you plan on having a rental car, then you can´t go wrong with the Dorset. 
<br/>
<br/>Lance was very helpful and a great host!
<br/>
<br/>We look forward to coming back :-)"
18711,476043,2011-08-26,735995,Trish,"Just spent a wonderful week in Lance's property with my family. You couldn't ask for a nicer host. Prior to our arrival, he responded quickly to all my emails and immediately addressed any questions I had. The apartment was tasteful, clean, and located well for ease of movement around the city.  It was a positive experience on every level. "
18711,658961,2011-10-24,1217929,Chris,Had a great weekend in Boston. The accommodations were spectacular. The host was very responsive and had very simple check in/out procedures. Hope to come back next year!
18711,1596370,2012-06-30,2646238,Jonathan,"Great location about 10 minutes outside of downtown Boston.  We rented a car and drove into the city but I think there is public transportation close by.  Parking our car was never an issue...  We always found a good spot close to the location.  
<br/>The accomodations were very nice...  everything was extremely clean and the location is safe.  There are two great breakfast joints close by, Mckenna's Cafe (a short drive away), and the SugarBowl (a short walk away), along with a Dunkin Donuts close by.  For dinner there is a pretty good restaurant right next door.  For fitness enthusiasts there is a Crossfit down the street, I think it's called Crossfit Southie but I didn't have a chance to visit it.  Next time!  
<br/>All in all for the price, location, size, and everything else I highly recommend this place as a great place to stay.  
<br/>Next time I go to Boston, this is my place.  "
18711,1688318,2012-07-12,1595147,Odile,"It was a perfect apartment to explore Boston and Cambridge. 
<br/>There was A Subway station on walking distance.  The neigbour was a very nice restaurant.  
<br/>We loved the fact that the apartment was clean with a well functioning airco and spacy. 
<br/>
<br/>Thanks for our stay at your apartment,

18711,1930312,2012-08-09,2188401,Lise,"Very clean and spacious appartment. Very functionnal kitchen.
<br/>A bit remoted from Boston center but easy to access with train + bus or bus. Good food commodities in the neighbourhood."
18711,2652123,2012-10-18,1368103,Ann,"Stayed In a party of three...The Dorset is the lower apartment. 
<br/>All four floors are leased to other travellers although there is little interaction.
<br/>It is a very well presented and clean apartment with a new kitchen and good heating...one bathroom for six or seven could be an issue ...
<br/>The area is on the edge of gentrification, there is a fabulous contemporary italianish restaurant next door, and the 8 minute walk to the red line metro gives access to all of boston. 
<br/>My usual..over ten... airbnb bookings include human contact so this one came as a surprise......there was no handing over keys or making sure you are ok, giving local advice, or asking if you need anything...none of that...it's all  very much a business...you are emailed the rules including that you must read the other rules once you are in the apartment.. If you don't leave the building by 11am and text re your departure, you will be charged a days rent. Theres no conversation, and seemingly no  compromise, and only minimal text messages...from two different people, one of whom didn't seem to know when we were leaving.., and sent the only welcoming email as we left Boston.
<br/>The photographs show a dining room on the official dorset site....there is no dining room,  it is now the third bedroom.... 6 people can not eat at the tiny glass kitchen table in this apartment. It's on the knees in the small lounge room ...with seating for 4.
<br/>the fold out futon in the ""office"" is in a very small storage area , with no working lights and what appears to be left over household goods accumulated at one end.
<br/>
<br/>We loved Boston, and the apartment is reasonably priced, and very good for two couples... but it's not an airbnb experience....
<br/>"
18711,11513691,2014-04-06,6339900,Marlena,"I stayed at Lance Swank property during a university visit to Boston. We had 5 people so needed a big space. We really enjoyed our stay, it feels like home away from home. The app/directions are very easy to follow and when we found something missing in the house ""air dryer"" it was brought to us the next morning. Overall I would give a 5 star because of the great app they have and really enjoyed our stay. "
18711,14169658,2014-06-13,388385,Eduardo,"The Dorset apartment was ok.  Clean, everything needed was there, etc.  Location was not the best in town, but again, wasn't bad.  All kind of services nearby.  Customer service was the best!!!!  Lack of tv's in bedrooms and the one is there, is in a room that is very uncomfortable to watch.  Train station is also very close and transportation was not a problem at all.  My only complain is the access to A/C - Heat.  Is locked in a box and no way to control the climate inside the apartment.  In an overall, great value for the price.  Would I recommend it????  mmmmmmmm"
18711,27471526,2015-03-05,27425665,Juan Jose,"Good apartment as described , clean  cozy and good location. Thanks swank properties."
18711,32490258,2015-05-19,22999461,Dan,"Apartment worked out really worked out really well.
<br/>Top five things:
<br/>1. Key less entry made it easy for guests to come and go at different times
<br/>2. Parking was easy on Boston St. right out front
<br/>3. Very clean and new
<br/>4. Easy walk to the Andrew Square Red Line Stop
<br/>5. Good equipment in kitchen with all the essentials for coffee"
18711,142876174,2017-04-09,110479898,Alex,"L'appartement était très confortable. Tout était conforme à ce qui était indiqué dans l'annonce. Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour. Pour ceux qui voyageraient avec une poussette et des jeunes enfants, pour accéder à l'appartement, on doit monter quelques marches assez abruptes, même pour accéder à l'appartement au premier étage. "
18711,150269217,2017-05-07,22730758,Lindsay,"Great location, 9 minutes from the airport. Great for families, has lots of pots, pans, and plates for making meals at home.  Thr downfall is that there is only 1 bathroom and the water pressure was not good. Also, we were not able to figure out the thermostat to adjust the temp of the apartment. The host is a property management company that is very communicative. "
18711,151881710,2017-05-14,48793631,Lori,"The Dorset was clean and comfortable. I appreciated the full sized kitchen and being able to control the thermostat through my phone app. A short walk to the subway and shopping area, though we used Uber for most trips. TV worked great. "
18711,158611492,2017-06-07,45298490,Han,The apartment is super big. Beds are comfortable and kitchen has everything you need for cooking.
18711,161840259,2017-06-18,77062274,Yeri Alice,"The house was approachable from public transportation. Also had a large store (stop &shop), so we were able to buy our needs easily. The house was very family-friendly and clean. It felt like home:) The host is also very kind and helped through all my requests. It was a great home in Boston!"
18711,172678896,2017-07-21,73656489,Alejandro,"All is perfect, I recommend It 100 %"
18711,180515253,2017-08-10,110362686,Sébastien,"Perfectly located and well equipped, but extremely noisy, both from inside and outside the building."
18711,190561828,2017-09-04,119858518,Tom,My friends and I enjoyed our stay
18711,199704125,2017-10-02,72603,Ted,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Dorset. The space is beautiful and clean, with fairly easy access to downtown Boston. The beds were comfortable, loved the high ceilings, and we made full use of the kitchen and living room areas. Only complaints were we could hear our upstairs neighbors (as it's an old house there were some creaky floorboards) and didn't love having to download a separate property management app to manage the booking. Would still be happy to recommend the space though."
18711,201962410,2017-10-09,26989283,Stephanie,"Lance's apartment was perfect for my group of five guests. Everything was incredibly clean and the check-in and check-out process was incredibly easy.<br/>While not in the center of Boston, the commute was incredibly short to many of Bostons attractions. I would definitely recommend this apartment to any group visiting the Boston area."
18711,204089213,2017-10-16,39672321,Mark,"What a great place, very clean and cosy apartment. We were given plenty of towels for our stay and everything is explained clearly."
18711,208476856,2017-11-01,26008579,Mike,"Our time in Boston was fantastic. The home was very clean and it is right next door to a restaurant. The location in South Boston was pretty convenient too, about a 20 minute drive to Boston Common. The host Lance was great and he communicated well through the Swank application as well as email. If we go back to Boston (which I do believe we will) we will be staying in a Swank Property. If you are not from Boston, parking can be a bit tricky so park and then Uber or Lyft elsewhere. Such a great city and property."
18711,214320884,2017-11-25,11456378,Patrice,"This apartment is centrally located in Dorchester and close to many attractions and all kinds of shopping. Parking on the street was easy. The door codes worked very well; everything was very clean. The apartment is nicely appointed with tasteful furniture; its three bedrooms are all good sized. We had planned to host a dinner there, since it was Thanksgiving, but I neglected to confirm that there was a dining table. My fault entirely, but we were disappointed. The challenges: The heating system is controlled by a downloadable app, but even after adjusting it there, we found the bedrooms extremely hot, especially in the middle of the night. Under Amenities in the listing, soap and shampoo are listed, but none were provided. I asked the host by email if they were in a closet elsewhere, but received no reply. The bathroom is plenty big, but has only enough shelves and towel bars for one person. The kitchen is well set up for 2 to 4 people, but the apartment has three bedrooms. I think this could be a spectacular place if a little more thought were put into the user experience."
18711,216387664,2017-12-03,12035232,Peter,"So a couple things about this place and then more of a review on this company. The Place: 1. This a multi unit house and this unit is on the 1st floor but still up some steep steps. The unit is quite nice with very comfortable bedding (big plus). The kitchen is well equipped for light cooking. The bathroom though could use some upgrading to match the rest of the house. Still had good water pressure and plenty of hot water. 2. If you have upstairs neighbors be prepared for noise. It's an old house so lots of creaking from people walking upstairs. Not terribly surprising but important to know if you're a light sleeper. 3. You aren't really very conveniently located to public transit so we Lyft'ed everywhere. The Company: So a note to those who may not understand, this rental property is operated by Swank Properties not an individual. There are some ups and downs about this. Ups: fairly curated interactions. An app that assists in check-in and check-out. The most useful part of the app was actually a walking guide to the neighborhood, sharing places to eat and shop etc. Downs: You are completely unimportant to this company. 1. Check in - Check Out. Read carefully because this company uses completely non-standard check in and check out times. For them, standard is 5:30 pm check in and 10 am check out. But don't worry, as a courtesy they will push it up to 4:30 and 11 respectively.... if you email them in advance, some kind of courtesy. But if you want a standard check in of 3pm, be prepared to fork over another $45 bucks. They say it's to offset the cost of rearranging their cleaning crew... but really to me it just felt like a way to squeeze more money out of people. 2. Disrepair in the house: I found the first morning that the ironing board was filthy and the iron covered in something. It was completely unusable. Then that same morning on a piece of torn up carpet I stepped on a carpet tact. Batteries in the remotes for the TV also needed to be changed and the house sound system didn't work. All of these issues were laid out in a series of emails to them. The response? A one sentence email. Yes they sent over a different iron and board (new iron still needed to be cleaned) and supposedly they sent someone to check the carpet tact (which I had already removed because of the safety hazard) but the response was completely insufficient and reeked of indifference to me. This is not what I've come to expect from AirBnB hosts because usually they are people and they care about you being safe and enjoying their home. So this place gets no stars truthfully for the company but if the issues with the company were fixed the house itself is probably a 4 star stay. Thus my 2 star rating. I would recommend..."
18711,221471252,2017-12-26,117712884,Jennifer,Pros: Nice & Clean<br/>Cons: UNREACHABLE HOST<br/>           Non functioning TV most of our     visit<br/>           Street parking
18711,243088402,2018-03-14,38282766,Masa,"I have to rate less star because boiler of hot shower was broken<br/>we could not use hot shower for 4 nights in 5 nights staying and room was cold, although landlord tried to fix it.<br/>everything is fine except it."
18711,247189837,2018-03-27,88136160,Danielle,"This apartment is a hidden gem in a not so great neighborhood. The place was incredibly clean inside and the beds were very comfortable. My friends and I wished there was a better setup in the living room area so we could all hang out and be comfortable. <br/>The neighborhood is not that nice and the street the apartment is on is INCREDIBLY BUSY. We were woken up multiple times during the night due to noise (people yelling, horns, traffic). It’s unforntuate because the place is nice and in decent driving distance from everything we wanted to see. <br/>Nothing the host can really do about that, but thought people should know! <br/>Overall it is a really nice place, as long as you don’t mind that noise!"
18711,262644509,2018-05-09,71392501,Ran,Great place
18711,274256528,2018-06-08,77275545,Roberto,Thank you for everything.<br/>We had problems with the heating and Lance salved it quickly and effectively.<br/>Good apartment and very clean.
18711,282178209,2018-06-26,10363129,Sarah,"The apartment is located in a charming building.  The neighborhood has lots of character and was always safe during our stay.  There is a great restaurant next door which was convenient for us.  Parking was fine. At times we had to park around the corner a few feet past the building.  The subway was near by as well, which we found handy when we did not want to drive downtown.<br/>Accessing the apartment was easy, yet the apartment felt safe with a locked entrance.  The apartment itself had plenty of space for four adults and one toddler.  It was very clean.  I'm extremely picky about mattresses due arthritis.  My mattress was great.  I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable it was.  <br/>I would say the only hiccup we had was that the air conditioner would blow warm air at times and cool air at other times after we arrived.  We were unable to reach anyone until the day after we arrived due to us arriving later in the evening the night before.  They sent someone out that day to fix the problem.  We did have a fan as well.  The rest of the week the weather was fairly cool and we didn't really need to turn on the AC.<br/>I would defiantly recommend staying in the apartment to both friends and family who were interested in visiting Boston."
18711,291239152,2018-07-15,41734466,Andrew,"Clean location in Boston with comfortable beds. I was annoyed to have to communicate off the AirBnB app and with the two emails asking when I was getting there, how I was traveling, was I bringing a car, would I need later check out, etc. The air conditioning didn’t work the first night meaning open windows on a very noisy street. The app they required to adjust the thermostat didn’t work. "
18711,300578410,2018-08-02,194273300,Marcelle,Really appreciate it. Close to everything 
18711,307050920,2018-08-13,117559914,Reggie,Great stay in Boston. Went with two friends who have never done an Air BnB before and they loved it. It was perfect because we all had our own private room to sleep in. No complaints.
18711,312464367,2018-08-23,105923496,재훈,수세미가있었으면좋겠다
18711,319931967,2018-09-07,28095864,Eleanor,"The first thing to know about this apartment is that you must download a third-party app in order to stay here. They will not allow you to check in or out via the Airbnb app. <br/>The apartment is clean and more than roomy enough for three people to stay here, and the WiFi is functional. However, when we checked in two of the bedrooms had missing curtains, which is extremely unfortunate for a ground-floor apartment.<br/>Additionally, the apartment is kept VERY cold. Bring a sweater and socks, even if you’re staying in the summer!<br/>The apartment is located on a busy street, which means it’s fairly noisy even at night with traffic noise. <br/>If you don’t mind any of the above, however, it’s a good deal."
18711,345644977,2018-11-05,49050157,Jim,Very nice and trendy home. Great storage!  Very close to all of south Boston & inexpensive to U Er to convention centers
18711,421101421,2019-03-08,52595241,Tennin,３つのダブルベッドと１つ大きなソファーがある便利なお家でした！
18711,423524597,2019-03-14,241499953,Michael,"It's a very cute apartment in a nice building with good parking. It's within 20 minutes of everything we went to and was very easy to drive to. The price is nice but having to get the separate app is inconvenient considering they only send maybe 1 message through it. The place was clean and furnished with very soft sheets and nice towels, but the heating was kinda iffy (some rooms were sweating hot and others had a chill). <br/>But they didn't realize that when I paid for the 14th and said my check out was at 10am, I meant ""I'm going to be leaving the 15th at 10am"" not ""I'm checking out the 14th"".<br/>Although I'd love to stay here again I'd have to be sure they understand my party's plans more clearly because I do not want that to happen again."
18711,426291901,2019-03-20,104940475,Jayson,"Lance's place is great, an outstanding value.  The restaurant next door, literally 20 feet away, is AMAZING too!  The experience is highly recommended."
18711,431691319,2019-04-01,178645827,Troy,"The house was rather nice, looked much nicer in person, my friends and I were all surprised by its size as well for a place in Boston. The mobile app is rather easy to use and has a lot of information about so places to go and what’s all around you"
18711,445522137,2019-04-29,135931263,Adam,Everything was great. There is an amazing restaurant literally next door with great food. Decent travel time to the city center. Great price for the amenities included. No complaints here. Would book again for sure.
18711,455377319,2019-05-19,221256910,Alison,This is a value level location. It’s a 15 minute walk to the redline. Lance responded to our concerns with the thermostat in a timely manner. Check in and out worked well with the app.
18711,456473631,2019-05-21,69363625,Jen,Close to a local brewery which was great
18711,507527402,2019-08-11,123012432,玉,位置很好，出行方便，房屋有点旧
18711,541677467,2019-10-05,31398453,Lisa,"We had an awesome extended stay at the Dorset while our home was undergoing renovations. The apartment was well equipped and had nice touches like hooks by the door and a sample menu from the upscale restaurant next door. Such a cute area of historic Dorchester, super convenient to the highway, Columbia Rd, Mass Ave, and the SouthBay Mall. <br/>Sound does travel from inside and outside the building, so not the best choice if you’re a light sleeper. Street parking was never a problem."
18711,961567868651598064,2023-08-19,436019467,Alexa Jeanne,"My recent stay at this Airbnb was excellent value overall. The apartment's high ceilings, hardwood floors, and numerous windows made for a welcoming ambiance. The amenities, including in-unit washer dryer, central A/C, and dishwasher, added convenience, though we encountered minor water heating issues resolved by Lance, the host.<br/>The apartment's comfortable and thoughtful furnishings were standout features. Being next to a nice restaurant and a BlueBikes dock was convenient. The presence of a 7-Eleven and the relatively close distance to Stop & Shop and Target were also convenient for any necessities. However, the noise from the busy roads could be disruptive at night. On the downside, the neighborhood's safety was a concern, as our food deliveries were stolen a couple of times.<br/>Despite this, the place remains a comfortable and affordable option. Overall, I'd recommend it for the value it offers."
29765,46110,2010-05-24,129249,Martin,"Amazingly charming suite, great location to visit Boston. Close to the Freedom trail in Charlestown. Highly recommended
<br/>
<br/>Thanks for everything again"

The location is close to everything and in a very nice part of Charelstown.  The decor so lovely and it was stocked with bagels, eggs, snacks, milk, coffee, juice...and even a bottle of wine! The experience was amazing! I will recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to have a magical stay in the Boston area.  I don't think you'll find a nicer place for this price anywhere! Thank you for the hospitality! We look forward to visiting again someday!"
29765,55354,2010-06-20,141727,Kat,"So clean and beautifully decorated! Nice area and cute building!  I felt right at home, the stocked kitchen and Ben bringing up some extra ice cubes really was the extra mile! Everyone should want to.stay here!! Thanks! "
29765,56552,2010-06-23,31896,Russell,"We had such a lovely stay here. Elizabeth is a great host, had all kinds of great info for the neighborhood, stocked the fridge, left us a bottle of wine and even a CD of Moroccan music. We felt so spoiled. HIghly recommend spending a night here. If we're back in Boston any time we'll definitely want to stay here again."
29765,60688,2010-07-04,140888,Miha,"This was our first time that we staid in apartment with host and I can say that was one of our best holidays ever.
<br/>
<br/>House was very beautiful, interior is old and decorated with charming furniture from Morocco. 
<br/>
<br/>Elizabeth is very friendly and helpful host. She answered all our questions and she stocked the fridge every day for us.
<br/>
<br/>Location is great in lovely neighborhood with near by supermarket and close to the city center.
<br/>
<br/>I recommend staying here for all travelers who would like to have different accommodation with new personal experience compared  from thousands tourists who stay in hotels in downtown Boston. 
<br/>
<br/>Elizabeth, thank you for everything!"
29765,61484,2010-07-05,155697,Yevgeniy,What a wonderful host and a great place. Elizabeth was punctual and friendly. The place is immaculate and tastefully decorated. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are in Boston.
29765,62786,2010-07-09,150704,Vasudha,"Elizabeth was a wonderful host. She took care of the smallest detail while I was there, including keeping the room comfortable and clean everyday. The fridge was well stocked as was her kitchen. She put fresh roses in the bedroom everyday. I would highly recommend her place to anyone who visits Boston."
29765,65248,2010-07-16,148361,Chelsea,"Staying at Elizabeth's is a real treasure. She has a talent for decorating and was a great host. She gave us maps of the areas, stocked our fridge with goodies, travel size shampoo, conditioner, towels, etc. In a nutshell, everything you could ask for. She will definitely be the person I contact for another stay in the future! Thanks again!
<br/>Chelsea and Matthew"

We had everything we needed for the stay.  Quick walk from the T and great access to the city.  A unique and great experience while in Boston!  Highly recommended.
29765,76890,2010-08-11,175257,Andy,Our stay in Boston was incredible! The price was cheaper than a hotel and the experience was ten times better. Elizabeth had the ffridge stocked and even left us a bottle of wine! The apartment was decorated gorgeously and I can't say enough great things about our stay. The location was great. It was right near the orange T station. Definitely will be back next time I am in Boston. Thanks so much Elizabeth!
29765,78172,2010-08-14,154032,Doug,Amazing accommodations! Loved the location and the apartment was amazing. Elizabeth has an eye for detail. The apartment was spacious and the moroccan theme was beautiful.  It was truly an amazing place to stay and a real bargain.  We would highly recommend. 
29765,79366,2010-08-16,57312,Ron,"Let me just say that this rental exceeded even my high expectations.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment is GORGEOUS, and the location is divine. Easy walk to the USS Constitution and the North End, beautiful surroundings, delicious food left for us, and a wonderful experience all around.
<br/>
<br/>In addition, Elizabeth is really nice to talk to and had great ideas of things to do in the area.
<br/>
<br/>I went there for a getaway weekend with a friend, and it could not have been better. I'm considering purchasing a weekend there as a birthday gift for a friend. HIGHLY recommended."
29765,91746,2010-09-07,45689,Charla,"Elizabeth has thought of everything!  Her attention to detail is just amazing.  The Moroccan Suite certainly has the WOW! factor and Elizabeth is very generous with her best quality towels and home furnishings, including the most amazing antique fountain from Fez in the bedroom!  We have already recommended this wonderful experience to our son and his partner, but it is booked out during their visit!  The king-size bed with canopy was very comfortable and the special lighting and ambience made our 4 day holiday in Boston a very special experience.
<br/>Thank you Elizabeth and we certainly hope to return one day.
<br/>Charla and Chris"
29765,97434,2010-09-15,161183,Jonka,Elizabeth is a very nice host and her beautiful house is a wonderful place to stay. It's near the T-station and only a 15 minute walk to cambridge side galleria. She stocked the fridge with everything we need. We had a great time at the moroccan suite with all the lovely details and decoration. I would definitely book the suite again. Elizabeth thanks for everything. Jonka and Julian
29765,98814,2010-09-17,165977,Robert And Heather,Elizabeth was an exceptional host and her suite was outstanding.  Her eye for design is not lost on the space and the history of some of the original art work was fascinating.  Several fine restaurants are walking distance from the suite and the neighborhood was very safe.  I would definitely book with her again and early if returning to the Boston area.
29765,105196,2010-09-26,159935,Kelly,"My husband and I had a great stay in Boston at the Moroccan suite. It is a great location-only a 10 minute or so walk to the T station. We felt like Boston residents for a week! The place was so interesting and beautifully decorated. Elizabeth stocked breakfast, coffee and teas, and left a bottle of wine. How nice! There were also lovely soaps and things in the bathroom that smelled great! I would highly recommend staying here; it was a wonderful part of our vacation."
29765,108516,2010-09-30,158283,Wayne,"We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful space, and Elizabeth is a most gracious host. The spacious apartment is even more beautiful than the photos, with furnishings and artwork from Morocco. It is located on a quiet side street in a vibrant neighborhood near coffee houses, great restaurants and bars. It is easy walking distance to the Freedom Trail and the T (subway). Elizabeth is an excellent hostess, and even provides detailed written instructions on how to get around the Boston area, favorite restaurants, sightseeing and more. You will love it!"
29765,114574,2010-10-09,163001,Robert,"Sharon and I could not have been more pleased. Elizabeth's suite is exceptional. Very charming, very comfortable, very covenient. She was a wonderful host and seemingly anticipated all of our needs. Our stay here added so much to our travel experience. We highly recommend Elizabeth and this suite and we would definitely return here again. Thank you, Elizabeth!"

29765,120469,2010-10-17,161465,Sheralyn,"Our stay in the Moroccan Suite was perfect!  The location was convenient to everything we wanted to see and do while we were in the Boston area and Elizabeth was a perfect host.  The neighborhood was clean and quiet with several wonderful restaurants within easy walking distance of the suite.  The accommodations are clean, comfortable, and the atmosphere oh so pleasant and relaxing after a long day of sightseeing.  This suite was SO much better than any hotel room we could have found in the same price range- a great value and we would never consider staying anywhere else if we return to the Boston area!"
29765,122638,2010-10-19,249384,Stephanie,"Elizabeth was an AMAZING host and her suite is absolutely beautiful. The pics do not do the suite justice..I cant tell you how much peace, warmth, and coziness this suite provides.Upon walking into the suite there's this lovely zen music playing which welcomes you into the space you are entering. I highly recommend you stay here! I'm already thinking about future trips at Elizabeth suite. I cant say enough wonderful things about Elizabeth...since this was my first trip to Boston and it was going to be two days.. i wanted to ensure I had enough time to do everything I planned and Elizabeth was so nice to look over my list to tell me what was doable along with providing recommendations of her own. one recommendation was this delicious brunch spot Accquavit (I believe is the name). Yummy! Theres also a guide in the suite of things to do and places to try. There were so many warm touches in the apt like breakfast in the fridge, tea, nuts, and apples on the counter, and a bottle of wine in the living room. Since im always cold I enjoyed the heaters in the two rooms. There's also a fireplace but the heaters were just fine for me.It really was a home away from home. The suite is located in a wonderful area that isn't far from little italy/freedom trail. The suite is spacious...I came with my best friend and there was enough space for us to do our own thing (she studied in the bedroom while i relaxed in the living room). I LOVE LOVE this place!"
29765,124189,2010-10-22,182032,Elissa,"Wow!!.Elizabeth's hospitality, eye for decor and passion for other cultures are remarkable. This place was a real find, with many unique touches, comfortable, high quality furnishings and a great location. Elizabeth was very gracious and informative about the apartment, the furnishings and about places to eat nearby. All this despite being exceptionally busy with a wedding party coming in that night. Provision were generous and the kitchen a delight to cook in. Thanks so much Elizabeth, we have already recommended your place to at least 3 other couples and we'd love to return ourselves, even just to enjoy the decor of your beautiful apartments and to eat at the local Moroccan restaurant again. Highly recommended!."

Next trip to Boston, we'll be making sure to check back into Elizabeth's place. Thanks for everything, Elizabeth!"
29765,140060,2010-11-16,262104,Dave,Moroccan suite is a unique experience! Elizabeth took care of all details as promised; fridge well stocked with goodies and even a bottle of wine! Nice for a romantic getaway or for someone who is looking for a cool and funky place to stay. Elizabeth obviously has an eye for design and the suite is just a really interesting space. It's within walking distance of Community College T stop and a bunch of neighborhood stores. The location is in a nice neighborhood from what I could tell. Overall was very satisfied.
29765,149659,2010-12-06,285158,Stephen,"This place is truly a gem. Elizabeth has done an amazing job in creating a warm and exotic space. My girlfriend and myself felt so welcomed and at home here. The location is great. Five min walk to the T. So close to the North end and many fantastic places to eat and drink. Elizabeth went out of her way to take care of us and our needs. I wish I could give her 6 stars. She left wine and flowers out to greet us. All the fixings for a great breakfast. Even hooked up the chocolate. I mean really I couldn't rave more about my experience here. I will def be staying here again. Thank you again Elizabeth for being such an amazing host and sharing your space with the world. 
<br/>
<br/>Stephen and Ashley. "
29765,168676,2011-01-10,274284,Daniela,"looking for an apartment in Boston I gladly found this wonderful suite - it is marvellous, wonderfull, overwhelming  - everything you need is there and even more .... Elizabeth is such a carying host:: always filled fridge adjusted to your needs and wishes..; she is so kind and helpfull - you cant get a better host. The apartment is ideally located - you can easily get to the center, everything in walking distance - at least for us. And if you prefer the T (underground) or the bus it's also only about a some minutes walk. We liked it so much to stay there and to get known to Elizabeth that we will come back soon for sure..
<br/>Daniela and Carl / Vienna"
29765,172668,2011-01-20,300468,Roy,"my girlfriend and i had a wonderful time. we were only there for very long but our stay was short and sweet! the bed and pillows are as a comfortable as it gets and elizabeth leaves all the ingredients for a nice breakfast.all the moroccan stylings piqued our curiosity and added to general feeling of ""awesomeness"" and luxury already present. additionally, there are plenty of places to eat in the neighborhood, as well as a small shopping center nearby to get whatever you need. the walk to and from the T train (orange line) is very short, and that same line will get to a bunch of points of interest (prudential center, south station, etc.).
<br/>
<br/>cliff's notes: the suite is sweet and elizabeth is a very personable and personable host. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
29765,183433,2011-02-16,381030,Lizandre,"Very high quality, great experience. The design of the suite is unique and exudes the Moroccan style. The place is very, very clean and comfortable, well decorated and furnished, and also spacious for the great rates. Elizabeth was also a very great host. She greeted us with a smile, tour and complimentary wine. Elizabeth also stocked the fridge and counter with snacks, water and breakfast foods. The suite is in a great location with a variety of local and international restaurants within close proximity. It is very close to the subway, as well.

29765,188679,2011-02-26,359582,Albert,"The suite was beautifully and uniquely furnished.  We counted ourselves lucky to have found it (it was well-positioned on the Web).  Our hostess was responsive and thoughtful -- all of the amenities we desired were provided.  There was also lots of useful information provided in a binder in the suite -- restaurants, local history, discussions about the furnishings, etc.  We would certainly go back there again.
<br/>Also, the location is good -- handy to the North End, but with street parking possible."
29765,201969,2011-03-18,252816,Federica,The Suite is amazing! We spent 3 days in Boston and we had a very positive impression of this house. The kitchen is full equipped and the bed is the most confortable i've ever tried! The maroccan decor is very accurate till the last details. I suggest this solution to everyone!! It's a little piece of heaven! 
29765,210542,2011-03-28,280775,Hitesh,Elizabeth was a perfect host. She was flexible and accommodating of our travel schedule. Her place is pleasantly unique as well as equally welcoming. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider staying at her place again. 
29765,225876,2011-04-13,483498,Farrari,"Thank you Elizabeth for a wonderful and truly beautiful place for me to celebrate my birthday with my loved one. We had such a great stay, we will recommend your places to many of our friends who come to Boston for either business trips or vacations often. Special thanks to you for a very well decorated top floor suite and the red wine just hit a home run in our hearts. I can't thank you enough for everything you have done in this place. Five-star all the way!"
29765,227819,2011-04-16,437525,Chris,"Our stay at the Moroccon Suite was more than we expected. Elizabeth is a very thoughtful, caring  and comfortable host. The room and  all the work  she put into making us feel  comfortable  during our stay made this a great experience.  Having a kitchen for breakfast, or whatever meal gave  a very relaxed feeling to our stay. This is a real gem of a find!"
29765,241660,2011-04-26,518764,Eunsol,Elizabeth and her place was amazing. All different kinds of unique lightings are there and they're beautiful. The bathroom is luxurious as you can see in the pictures. The location is good. Train station is in 5min walk. Elizabeth provided wine & breakfast for us. I would highly recommend Moroccan Suite!

29765,301460,2011-06-06,653219,Edward,"Outstanding, spacious room with kitchen and dinning space. Beautifully decorated with plush accommodations. A perfect breakfast and other  temptations were available within the refrigerator, along with a bottle of wine in the bedroom. This room and the attention to detail by the host, made my wife and my first visit to Boston a very memorable one. We will certainly be using the Moroccan suite again in the future.     "

29765,394436,2011-07-25,249384,Stephanie,"Elizabeth is an amazing host and i highly recommend her and her home to anyone! This is my second time at her lovely suite and I'm in love with it as it was my first time. This time I came for a girls weekend instead of just visiting Boston and my best friend described it as the best place for the getaway. Everything is superb from Elizabeth details to the suite to the caring touches of wine, breakfast, and snacks she provides. A home away from home indeed! I will be back! When you have Elizabeth suite why stay anywhere else while in Boston."
29765,530093,2011-09-14,398830,Belinda,"We recently stayed at Elizabeth's Moroccan Furnishings Apartment in Boston and it was fabulous.  The apartment is on the third floor and encompasses a large bedroom, bathroom, full kitchen and lounge.  The location in Charlestown is excellent, quiet but in easy walking distance to  Downtown.  Elizabeth left lots of information about what to see and where to visit, restaurants and a summary of the various beautiful furnishings in the apartment.  In addition to this, Elizabeth left a number of yummy things to eat and there was coffee, tea, sugar, oil etc all the basics needed to home cook which we did on one night.  We cannot speak more highly of this accommodation and if anyone is thinking of staying in Boston and they want a beautiful peaceful place to stay surrounded by lovely homes, streets and history than this is it.  "

29765,906240,2012-02-06,178807,Jeffrey,"Elizabeth is the most amazing host. We arrived and there was fantastic music playing and fresh orange juice waiting for us in the fridge. The physical space is one of the coolest places I've ever stayed in - 100% authentic and a beautiful escape from the city. 
<br/>
<br/>Thanks!"
29765,917859,2012-02-13,59047,Vina,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Moroccan luxury suite for our birthday and had the most wonderful time! Elizabeth was a wonderful host, she was there to help with all of our questions and needs.  The apartment is in a gorgeous area of boston, very close to plenty of great things to do.  Staying at the apartment made our weekend special, I would recommend it to anyone!"
29765,925114,2012-02-16,1217781,Michael,"It was Amazing!! I took my girlfriend here for Valentine's day for the night. The setting was very romantic and perfect for a couple. Elizabeth was super nice and left us with snacks, a bottle of wine, and breakfast. Really, the apartment is gorgeous. :)"
29765,949650,2012-02-26,1714053,Rebecca,"This room is amazing! It was such a relaxing atmosphere. My BF and I had had plans to go out that night, but the room was so lovely and it was pouring outside, so we just stayed in. THE BED IS SO COMFORTABLE!! We will definitely be returning someday. :D"
29765,991322,2012-03-12,1728679,Peter,"    We could not be more pleased with our stay at the Moroccan Suite. The space is a perfect mixture of a fine bed and breakfast with a stylish and trendy Moroccan museum.  The beverages and food included in the room were well received as was the selection of restaurants and the freedom trail being with in steps of the front door.  Just absolutely splendid and we hope to stay again.
<br/>

29765,1054917,2012-03-28,1717114,Jane,"Gorgeous interior; I love the colour & plush furnishings. It is actually cosier than it appears in the glossy photographs with sweetly, wonky floors. It feels like a house with history. It is unusual to find a place to stay with such character. I am an architect so I'm fussy about these things ;)
<br/>
<br/>Great position; walking distance to subway & Bunker Hill monument.
<br/>
<br/>Fantastic host; Elizabeth was very accomodating and well organised."
29765,1094688,2012-04-07,2014230,Christina,My fiancé and I stayed here one night back in April! This place is amazing! Elizabeth was so wonderful making sure we had everything to make our stay perfect! Anyone was likes to travel needs to see the pieces that Elizabeth has collected! Absolutely gorgeous! You will not be disappointed!!
29765,1146708,2012-04-18,1168031,Tom,"This place is a beautiful house built in the 1770's, but with all the modern convienences. Elizabeth was a great host who even saved us from a not so honest cab driver who tried to charge us twice for one ride. Everything was provided for us to help in our exploration of the Boston area ie. Guidebooks, transportation info etc. Breakfast items were tasty and plentiful. The neighborhood is the historic Bunker Hill area and is very safe and friendly. We were also only a short walk from the equally Historic North end where Paul Reveres house and the Old North Church are located as well as many wonderful Italian restaurants. We definately hope to return someday."
29765,1160355,2012-04-21,2011089,Suping,Perfect！Elizabeth!
29765,1223676,2012-05-03,1615517,Gildo,"Elizabeth's place is amazing!!!! You won't find any 5 star hotel better than Maroccan Suite!
<br/>
<br/>She is a wonderful host, and will give you all the information about the city, and places to go!
<br/>
<br/>I strongly recommend and will be back for sure!"
29765,1342797,2012-05-24,1572699,Lopa,"This place is absolutely beautiful. The wood beam architecture is artistic and old-world, the furnishings are delightful and luxurious, and the home is immaculate and spacious. 
<br/>
<br/>It's much more like staying in a B&B as opposed to an ""AirBnB"", at least compared to my other AirBnB experiences. 
<br/>
<br/>And compared to the other AirBnB spots available in Cambridge, I'd say it's absolutely worth the price. "
29765,1349356,2012-05-26,1694969,Laura,"A quiet, romantic oasis in one of the most picturesque areas of hectic Boston! There aren't enough superlatives to describe these accommodations and the host."
29765,1818366,2012-07-28,2368550,Adrian,We enjoyed our stay very much. We both agreed this is the most comfortable bed we have slept in our entire lives. 
29765,1979466,2012-08-14,694630,Tarleton,"Superb apartment, funky and awesome, and near enough to the T stop and therefore all of Boston. Elizabeth was excellent, went over and above on making sure everything was just as we hoped."
29765,2216055,2012-09-06,3209140,Austin,"We had a wonderful two days, and couldn't ask for much more.  "
29765,2236198,2012-09-09,1361319,Lucy,"One word: WOW! What a beautiful suite this was! Our only regret was not being able to stay longer. Immaculately presented with the comfiest bed ever, we would recommend anyone to stay here for a touch of luxury in the heart of charming Charlestown! Elizabeth was a charming host and brightened our last day with a gift of a bottle of bubbles :) which we enjoyed in her pretty back yard... can't say enough good things about this place. Having travelled through New England staying in a variety of places, this one topped the lot - We will return! "
29765,2581619,2012-10-11,3577381,Kelly,"We spent two days exploring Boston from Elizabeth's wonderful Moroccan suite.  The location is excellent - short walk to Bunker Hill , The USS Constitution, and a Hop-on-Hop-off stop.  Great restaurants nearby.
<br/>
<br/>The suite is fantastic - more than your average B&B.  . It is private and quiet - in a great neighbourhood.  Elizabeth has thought of everything.  Most comfortable bed we've ever slept in, our own private living room filled with interesting books and DVDs, and incredible Moroccan furnishings.
<br/>
<br/>Elizabeth was warm and helpful - lots of suggestions of what to see and where to eat, and even booked our taxi for us. "
29765,2721642,2012-10-26,2648722,Judy,"I loved the luxury suite and we were so happy to have booked Elizabeth's place for our honeymoon. The interior was so beautiful and comfortable that we even stayed in one night just to enjoy the location more. It was so convenient to have a microwave and stovetop to make tea in the morning, and so sweet of Elizabeth to provide bags of tea and coffee as well. The unique textile were a luxurious touch. Elizabeth was a great host and even let us hang out and called us a cab to bring us to the airport the day of our departure. The town is full of charm and history and very convenient to the subway and if you want to do the full tourist experience the orange trolley stop is only a nice walk away. The guide that Elizabeth put together for the town of Charlestown and for Boston itself is full of gold mines. Such a unique spot but one I will never forget. Thanks Elizabeth!"
29765,2743804,2012-10-29,3180587,Ian,"We stayed at Elizabeth’s for 4 days at the end of October 2012, it was our first visit to Massachusetts and we were hoping to find the perfect place.
<br/>The pictures we’d seen on line were lovely however; in person it was it was fabulous! 
<br/>Unique, eclectic and the overall feel of the condo was very pleasant and inviting; we were comfortable and felt at home almost at once.
<br/>The day we were to leave was the day before hurricane Sandy was to hit, we left the condo as planned for the airport only to find that many flights were already canceled among them mine. Now stuck in Boston, with a huge storm coming and no place to stay because the hotels were full already and those that were not were EXTREMELY expensive, now facing spending days at the airport we decided to call Elizabeth to see if it were possible to return and wait out the storm. She was wonderful!  
<br/>Not only did she allow me to return she offer to come to the airport and pick me up if a taxi wasn’t available. She was a godsend, we plan return to Boston, and when we do I hope that we are able to stay at Elizabeth’s again. "
29765,2853339,2012-11-10,3763583,Stephanie,"This is a beautiful apartment that's super close to the financial district.  Elizabeth is a fantastic and gracious host.  I especially loved the fully stocked fridge (coffee, eggs, muffins) and snacks with all the stuff from trader joe's that I actually use at home (nuts, greek yogurt, etc.)!  When you travel a lot, sometimes that little things really make a big difference.  I HIGHLY recommend this place for a romantic weekend or for a business traveler (like myself) who wants a break from the sterile monotony of hotels.  "
29765,2922491,2012-11-19,3878626,Chontelle,Ah-mazing!!!! That's the only way to describe it. The place is even more beautiful than in the pics. The small touches that Elizabeth and bill put into the place is just gorgeous. It was my birthday weekend and just to make me feel special was a bottle of wine and a note. I was sooo sad to leave this place. It was like an oasis. Elizabeth and bill couldn't be more sweet and accommodating . The food was even stock with organic items from trader joes. Wow. I can't wait to go back!!!!
29765,3076444,2012-12-12,3712027,Kurt,"This was our engagement trip, so this suite was ideal. We had a wonderful time. Elizabeth was a great host, the furnishings were incredible. The fireplace was such a nice way to end of a day exploring Boston. I highly recommend staying here if Boston is your destination. The fridge is stocked for a hearty breakfast before you head out. Charlestown is a quaint little neighborhood with lots of history. We stayed 5 nights and still left so many things we want to explore, so definitely have plans to go back again. Thanks Elizabeth for a wonderful place for us to start our life together."
29765,4031314,2013-04-04,4820763,Petra,"Beautiful apartment, wonderful host! The spectacular decoration of the apartment was all we could hope for, the fridge was stocked (and was restocked daily) with breakfast items, everything was very clean, Elizabeth extremely helpful! We would come back any time!"
29765,5651065,2013-07-09,1139547,Amanda Marie,"The Moroccan suite was just lovely. We really enjoyed our Anniversary weekend in Boston from this location. It is in a lovely quiet neighborhood, with easy access to all of Boston. The suite its self was clean and ready on time. Check in with Margaret went without a hitch, we were pleased to find that we wear given keys to the private courtyard, which was divine.I would definitely recommend this property. "
29765,5732760,2013-07-14,6637341,Jennifer,"Our hosts were so kind to let us leave our bags early so we could enjoy the day in Boston before our actual check in later.  When we arrived late and tired, voila!  .... our bags were in our luxurious suite.  The accommodations were PERFECT!   Comfy bed, lots of room, super lovely and a terrific kitchen..  My only regret is that we didn't get to spend enough time in our suite.  Thank you so much for a wonderful stay.  We LOVE Boston!!"
29765,6323268,2013-08-08,6988110,Andrew,"We had such a great time at this cozy Moroccan suite on our visit to Boston. The room was clean and elegant, the host was easy to access, and everything was delivered as promised. To boot, I forgot half my wardrobe in the closet, and Elizabeth went beyond her duty to mail them back to Canada. 
<br/>
<br/>A wonderful host, a wonderful place. You should go!"
29765,7771234,2013-10-02,5990939,Adriana,My stay in the Moroccan suites was everything I hoped for and more. Elizabeth was an incredibly gracious host. The place is beautiful and inspiring. I will definitely come back!
29765,8458010,2013-11-01,6962742,Tim,This place was wonderful.  Very quiet and relaxing.  The fridge was stocked every day and the suite was cleaned every day. It was absolutely wonderful!
29765,8780189,2013-11-18,3878626,Chontelle,"This is the second birthday I have spent at Elizabeth's perfect place. She goes above and beyond to make me feel right at home. From the scent of fresh flowers when u walk in to the cleanliness of this ""oasis"" u are left yearning to come back. In addition I walked into a beautiful papyrus birthday card and hearty breakfast ingredients waiting to be cooked. Thank u Elizabeth and bill. It's a truly amazing place u have. I can't wait to plan my next stay with you. "
29765,8977931,2013-11-30,80034,Jackie,"Elizabeth was so accommodating, leaving Prosecco for us because she knew that we had a winery in CA.  She called to make sure that everything was fine when our son, daughter-in-law, and their friends came over for dinner one night.  The apartment was so well equipped with high quality soaps, shampoos, and lotions.  The location was fine for us as we could walk over the bridge and take the train anywhere.
<br/>The beautiful pieces that Elizabeth has collected and some designed by her make the Moroccan Suite feel like a visit to a Sultan's mini-palace."
29765,9071063,2013-12-04,185587,Osunlade,"elizabeth was the most gracious host ever!! the place was absolutely amazing and peaceful, the neighborhood quiet and perfectly situated near everything in boston..definitely my home for any future visits to the boston area!"
29765,9345140,2013-12-23,9664481,Theresa,"My overall rating would actually be a 4.5. Everything was extremely delightful and accommodating. The Owner and Staff were welcoming and made us have a home away from home experience. I was celebrating my 32nd birthday and the Owner was thoughtful enough to provide a card and bottle of delicious wine.The pictures on the website depicted the Bed and Breakfast perfectly. Also, the location was very convenient for any destination in Boston and nightlife entertainment. In addition, it was ideal for local public transportation (The ""T"") and there was a grocery story within a 5 minute walk. In addition, the bed could make one sleep for a life time and the B&B included books, movies and anything you'd need. Therefore, you really did not have a reason to leave. Further, the Owner (Elizabeth), her spouse (Bill) and her friend (Margaret) were very friendly, provided their personal phone numbers and email addresses to be contacted at anytime for any assistance. I would highly recommend this Moroccan getaway to anyone looking for peace, tranquility and relaxation. "
29765,10535612,2014-02-24,11346002,Osheta,"There are some people who exude ""home"", ""comfort"", ""welcome"", ""care"".  Elizabeth Gittings is one of them.  From her kind and thoughtful emails after our booking to find out any needs we may have while celebrating our ten year anniversary in her stunning suite to the delicious brunch items she left for us every morning—we have never felt more pampered than during our stay with Elizabeth. The suite itself is a must see.  The pictures simply do not do it justice. What makes the suite so special is you get a glimpse into Elizabeth's beautiful heart, keen eye,  and her passion for Morocco.  There is a book full of information that she put together herself describing the pieces she acquired on her many trips and history of the region that truly makes it feel like you've been transported to Morocco.  The memory my husband and I will always remember is how we were so flustered when we came in from our babysitters running late, our car service getting lost, and the rain,  that we were going to just order in a pizza and call it a night.  Can you imagine?  A pizza on our first night of our anniversary weekend?  But Elizabeth encouraged us to keep our reservation at a Moroccan-inspired restaurant just a short walk away from the suite and she even offered to call them to push back our reservation.  Armed with a borrowed umbrella (again from Elizabeth and her partner Bill), dressed up, and ready to shake off the events of the evening, my husband and I headed out and had a marvelous time.  It's this type of intuitive hospitality that Elizabeth offers her guests, that left an indelible mark our hearts.  We are so grateful to have met and stayed with Elizabeth.  Book this marvelous place.  It's worth every penny and more.  Elizabeth and her home are gems."
29765,10848694,2014-03-10,11228032,Sarah,We were absolutely blown away by our stay! I surprised my boyfriend with a weekend away from school and could not be happier with how it turned out. The pictures are very true to life and everything was wonderfully comfortable and updated. Elizabeth could not have been more accommodating and helpful! I would spend every weekend in the suite if I could!!
29765,16171844,2014-07-22,11609410,Tim,"Sometimes less is more so I will be brief and to the point: Elizabeth is a wonderful hostess, her suite is charming and delightful, and Charlestown is a great location if you want to be close to everything in Boston. This is a great find!"
29765,16257136,2014-07-24,4080570,Karen,"I LOVED THE MOROCCAN LUXURY SUITE and ELIZABETH + BILL!!  I am also an Airbnb Host with two very busy, high-end Airbnb listing in Santa Cruz, CA.  I work really hard to provide an amazing experience for my guests, so, when I was looking for the perfect place in Boston prior to a conference, I diligently searched 5-Star Listings, price no object.  I wanted my trip to be super special.  WOW!  I hit the jackpot!!  First of all, Elizabeth responded immediately and made me feel like an old friend coming to town.  She sent me all kinds of good information, including a clip from a TV Show where her splendid apartment was featured.  So exciting!  When I arrived at an un-Godly hour, Fabulous Bill was there to greet me and to help me with my luggage up to the penthouse suite in this historic building.  The apartment is simply divine, unique and beautiful.  Vibrant colors, textures and special artistic touches were everywhere.  There is a tranquil, beautifully appointed garden courtyard where we sat and had wine and cheeses in the warm evening breezes.  Bliss!  The neighborhood was outstanding!  Located in the oldest part of Boston, the neighborhood is filled with beautiful, quaint brick homes lovingly adorned with colorful flower boxes.  You pass right by the monument at Bunker Hill (I climbed the 294 steps to the top to take it spectacular 360 degree views).  Historical Parks and Gas Lamp lined narrow streets lead you down to the water's edge to Old Ironside.  The waterfront in Charlestown is really, really nice!  We dined at Pier 6, Elizabeth's recommendation, with sweeping views of the harbor and the Boston Skyline.  Cool breezes delighted us as we dined al fresco.  Simply wonderful!!  Elizabeth takes great pride in providing an outstanding experience -- every detail in place.  Elizabeth and Bill are caring hosts and her suites are divine!  I felt sad to leave and will definitely be back whenever I come to Boston!  For those seeking a unique and wonderful experience right out of Old Boston, the Luxury Moroccan Suite cannot be beat!"
29765,37253321,2015-07-05,1743298,Benjamin,"Elizabeth's home was an incredible fusion of styles - how often does one have the chance to stay in a classic, historic house / neighborhood, but adorned with elegant Moroccan  decor?  The hospitality was amazing as well; from the French press with coffee ready to use to the daily-replenished supply of pastries and orange juice in the morning. This was an unique luxury experience to remember. On top of it, Elizabeth was very accommodating to our needs for an early check-in. Thank you Elizabeth!!"
29765,58089523,2015-12-31,3301696,Nick,"Could not have been happier with Elizabeth's place! The space, its furnishings, the provided amenities, and Elizabeth's responsive hospitality far exceeded all expectations. Anyone who books a stay at Elizabeth's home is in for a real treat!"
29765,58714950,2016-01-03,28014264,Taylor,"Elizabeth was welcoming from the very start. It was my boyfriend's birthday, and I wanted to do something special for him while we were both in Boston.  We could only stay for one night and noticed the suite was available for the one night we needed.  I messaged Elizabeth, and she happily lifted to 2 night stay minimum to accommodate our needs.  When we arrived, her friendly assistant greeted us and showed us around the suite. We enjoyed a yummy bottle of Prosecco and were blown away by the luxury and comfort of the space. All in all a wonderful night! "
29765,61853148,2016-02-08,56928160,Paul,"Our stay at the Moroccan suite with Elizabeth as our host was without question an unforgettable getaway. The level of amazing furnishings, comfort, and luxury was exceptional. An extremely positive experience all the way around. We'll be back for sure. Thank you Elizabeth.
<br/>"
29765,65612540,2016-03-15,59465846,Alexa,"Elizabeth was a lovely and welcoming host - one of the best!
<br/>She was available the entire stay, offering her advice for day trips and locations to visit.  She was so helpful, but never in your way.
<br/>
<br/>Her place was decorated impeccably with treasures from her world travels.  It was large enough to enjoy a weekend for two - and so cozy we almost never wanted to leave.
<br/>"
29765,144681381,2017-04-16,94439159,Vivian,"I had the pleasure of staying in the luxurious Moroccan King Suite! If you are looking for a romantic and cozy place to relax or recharge after a fun day exploring the Boston area...this is definitely the place to stay. Elizabeth and her staff were very kind, friendly & dedicated to ensure my stay was a fantastic one. If you have an interest in travel or interior design as I do...it is obvious that Elizabeth has a great eye for detail & loves sharing treasures and creative ideas she has acquired from her experiences abroad. When I return to Boston, I will most definitely stay in Elizabeth's Boutique Bed & Breakfast again! Thank you Elizabeth and Staff for making my stay an extraordinary and a very memorable one! "
29765,190168245,2017-09-03,80993822,Mika,Elizabeth's place is beautiful and just exactly what was pictures. The staff and Elizabeth was extremely helpful! Would defiantly recommend and stay again.

It was quite an experience and we enjoyed any moment.<br/>location is great. close to some major Boston's attractions and several excellent restaurants.  Elizabeth was their when we needed and her tip helped as a lot.<br/>for sure we will recommend this place to all our friends.  this place is just charming. thank you."

In addition, it was tidied and restocked with tasty breakfast items on a daily basis. It is also in a perfect location,  just minutes into Boston but in a quiet, historic neighborhood full of small shops and restaurants. She and her staff went out of their way to make my stay enjoyable. I can highly recommend and am looking forward to a return visit."
29765,425314511039820153,2021-08-09,181637900,Leo,The Moroccan Luxury Suites are truly exemplary of why we love browsing for Airbnbs over chain hotels. The unit is part of an historic home in a downtown-adjacent yet peaceful part of Boston. As for beautiful interior choices and thoughtful amenities there are simply too many to start listing in a review. Thanks Elizabeth and staff!
29765,460781751098714966,2021-09-27,19583259,Leslie,"A romantic and exotic retreat in Charlestown, Boston…a stay in Elizabeth’s Moroccan-themed accommodation is treat for the senses. Immaculate, well-maintained and full of thoughtful extras, like flowers next to the bed and breakfast offerings delivered to your room, a stay here delivers a high end boutique hotel experience convenient to all that Boston has to offer. High end bedding and a super-comfy bed, beautiful heirloom-level furniture and accessories under two hundred year old wooden beams…just amazing! The kitchen and bathroom are also fully stocked with anything you would need. And Elizabeth and her staff are fabulous! This is one of my favorite Airbnb’s and I will definitely return again."

29765,693478512990422260,2022-08-14,64106836,Andrew,A key reason why we stay at AirBnB places is to experience unique lodging that adds to the destination we're traveling to.  The Moroccan suite was a magical destination exquisitely furnished with opulent furnishings and fixtures (so seemed museum-quality pieces!).  This 3rd-floor unit features a split plan with a lush bedroom and living/lounge area with a modern bathroom.  The attention to detail was seen in all the decor right down to the fresh flowers bedside.   And you'll feel like royalty sleeping under the rich canopy-covered bed!<br/>International travelers will appreciate power adapters for various electric plugs. <br/>We stayed here while helping our daughter move to Boston and most certainly will stay here again.  The location is central to the charm of Charlestown with all the other key attractions only minutes away.  You're in for a treat when you stay here!
29765,716710784876358239,2022-09-15,44834234,Kati,"The Moroccan suite was comfortable, beautiful, and a fabulous value. The location in Charlestown is fantastic - walking distance to Main St and restaurants, and even a lovely 1-2 mile walk to downtown Boston. The bed was so soft and cozy - the sheets were the comfiest I’ve ever slept on. Even the bath towels were luxurious. Elizabeth also included some lovely touches like coffee, cereal, and toiletries. This is far more space than you’d get at any hotel in the Boston area for a great price. I will definitely look here first when I return to Boston!"
29765,723843598822924228,2022-09-25,130905104,Myranda,Very charming Airbnb! I am an OCD clean freak and Elizabeth’s place was super clean!! My husband and I really enjoyed our time there and would recommend it to anyone wants to experience Charlestown/Boston area and wanting a clean relaxing place to end your nights.
29765,737654611925658904,2022-10-14,50208035,Carly Anne,"This location is AMAZING! It is in such a cute part of town with many yummy places easily in a short walking distance. The unit itself it’s so unique, cozy and aesthetically pleasing. We stayed on a rainy night that just sounded liked heaven with all the windows. It’s surprisingly not as loud as I thought it would be and the bed is very comfortable. I would 100% stay here again anytime. Elizabeth is an excellent host as well."
29765,742720580642364910,2022-10-21,5152671,David,"Elizabeth's place was an amazing place to stay while in Boston. Excellent location, amazing decor, and communicative host. Would highly recommend! Two things that I will note for future travelers, in case not immediately obvious: a) you have to climb a couple of flights of steps to get to the place. Nothing insane, but worth keeping in mind if you have issues with steps. b) even though the place is listening as an entire home, this is really an entirely self-contained suite within a larger building that I *think* is something of a boutique hotel. So there is a ""check in"" area, I think there might be other guests in the building at times, etc. The suite itself is still private, but might deviate slightly from your expectations if you think this is going to be a turnkey entire home in which you don't interact with the host or other guests.<br/>Thank you again Elizabeth!!!"
29765,979717887127715013,2023-09-13,71343000,Blake,A fantastic place to stay with super comfortable amenities. Elizabeth is a very kind and welcoming host. The house is a quick walk from the subway station so getting around Boston was a breeze. Would highly recommend this place to any couple traveling to the area.
40601,85608,2010-08-27,199513,Nick,"We loved staying at Robert's house. He was an excellent host, took us for a guided tour of Jamiaca Plain when we arrived and made us feel at home. The house is just like it looks online, and is very nice. There are lots of stairs, but they're not a big deal. It was really nice to have our own bathroom and his dog is also very friendly. We did most of our traveling around Boston on the train and the local T stop was an easy walk, plus trains run regularly. The local shops stock mostly organic food and are a bit pricey but it's a very welcoming neighbourhood. Would recommend anyone to go and stay there. Thanks Robert for a great stay."
40601,170167,2011-01-13,331107,Richard,"Robert was an excellent host. I had a late flight into Boston and was taking public transportation to his house; he was kind enough to allow me to show up after 10pm. He gave a tour of his home as soon as I got in and offered free range throughout while I was staying there. The room was more than enough space for me. There is a closet to hang all your clothes in, as well as a dresser for anything else. The bathroom is not connected to the room. However, it is just outside of the bedroom door, and it is indeed a private bath. He has a convenient desk in the room which was a perfect ""home office"" away from home with my laptop connected to the wireless Internet. It sure came in handy when my flight home was canceled! I had to rush to the airport to try to leave a day early and get out of Boston before a blizzard hit, and Robert said he would keep the room as is in case I was unable to catch an earlier flight.
<br/>
<br/>I spent most my time exploring the city and visiting friends in the area, so I didn't spend much time (except to sleep) in the house. It is pretty close to the T station which made going into Boston very easy, even while it was snowing. Robert was also helpful navigating me around town when I was questioning if I was taking the right trains. It cut quite a bit of travel time off my day.
<br/>
<br/>One other note: If you start to play with the dog, be ready to play for a while! Rocco loves to fetch and then lay it at your feet to throw again."
40601,173786,2011-01-23,348367,Jonathan,"Robert was a warm and kind host, and the room was clean and comfortable. Definitely recommended if you need a pleasant space in Jamaica Plain. "
40601,180177,2011-02-09,346046,Michael/Patricia,"Robert King is a gracious and thoughtful host and his home is wonderful:  Great bed, room/bath, house and location.  Extraordinary. "
40601,846949,2012-01-07,1445536,Vanitha," my husband and i stayed at Robert's place for 17 nights in dec2011-jan2012.  Robert was host par excellence....he not only offered a private room and bath but very open-heartedly offered us the use of his entire house ...from kitchen to additional bathroom , living room and even a fabulous study.  the house is on 4 floors so there was plenty of privacy. the kitchen was equipped for gourmet cooking....well lit with every possible utensil.  the living room had a nice fire for those cold evenings. our bedroom was immaculate and well furnished and full of light from 2 large windows.. there was a super high tech musical washer and dryer available for our use. the fourth floor with splendid windows and sunshine slanting in every morning is Robert's study which we used as a yoga and meditation room..  it was perfect. the house is decorated and furnished with restraint.... by which i mean no frilly curtains and doodads and kitsch on every surface.   the live plants in the rooms added a lot of vibrance and energy. an added bonus was Rocco the dog,  friendly but not slobbering.. a nice subdued canine who loved playing ball in silence.  altogether we had an A++ experience and even told Robert that the price could be upped.. for which all of you reading this will hate me.     signed   seasoned traveller."
40601,948558,2012-02-26,1304854,Ben,"Robert was great. His house is clean and organized with a ton of sunlight, and Rocco (his dog) is super friendly. Highly recommended!"
40601,994064,2012-03-13,1249562,Mercy,"Excellent accommodations - very clean and very comfortable! Robert shared his whole house with us and it was great! He has a nicely equipped kitchen, a comfortable dining area, a really nice back patio where you can enjoy drinks or lunch during warmer days, a comfortable living room with a TV, and a large study on the top floor.  He also allowed us to use his computer to get online when we needed to and his awesome washer and dryer duo, which was extremely convenient! Jamaica Plains was a great neighborhood and we were in a perfect location - within walking distance from the Orange line (no need to rent a car!), there's a park and a lake nearby (opportunities for a nice morning run!) and plenty of bars/restaurants/stores that are less than a 10 minute walk away.  Robert was a great host - very friendly and gave us suggestions on where to go and how to get there.  We had to book at the last minute (24 hours before our arrival) and even though we were arriving very late at night (after 10pm) Robert was extremely understanding and greeted us with a smile, showed us around his home, making us feel very welcome. Highly recommended!"
40601,1082735,2012-04-04,1585604,Camilla,"We stayed at Robert's home for five days. The house was very beautiful and big (four floors!) Our room was very clean and the bed incredibly comfortable, as the bathroom. In the kitchen we founded everything we needed. Robert is a very nice person and his dog Rocco's very educated.
<br/>The house (on a hill, better take a taxi if you've got big tolls) is a little far from the center of Boston, but metro&markets are near to home.  Perfect wireless, beautiful garden (with BBQ). "
40601,1153282,2012-04-19,2101244,Stephen,"Robert is a kind and helpful host. Moreover, his home and the room were safe, clean and comfortable. I highly recommend staying with Robert."
40601,1169970,2012-04-23,2037122,Selby,"Robert has a really attractive and comfortable house.  The room and bath were just what I was looking for, quiet, overlooking the garden in back,  the location in Jamaica Plain was perfect for my needs, very near Centre Street and all the stores and restaurants, as well as my daughter's condo, and Robert was an easy, welcoming host. Parking was no problem.  I enjoyed my stay very much and look forward to another visit."
40601,1213138,2012-05-01,2206688,Jeremy,"This is a beautiful property in a very cool and fun area of Boston. It is close to the shops and restaurants of Centre Street in Jamaica Plain, and the street is very quiet and safe. It is also a short walk to the Orange line subway on the Boston transit system, that takes you straight into the Back Bay, and downtown areas within 20 minutes.  The room is clean, relatively private and well cared for. Robert is a gracious host. Highly recommended."
40601,1262843,2012-05-11,1962076,Maria Sol,"Buenisimo Robert un capo! Muy buena Onda y Jamaica Plain esta cerca del downtown y es muy lindo. Lo que ves en la foto es asi. La casa impecable, su perrito un amor. Recomendable! Divino! "
40601,3350856,2013-01-15,3957635,Ann,Robert was a great host and very hospitable. His home and accommodations are lovely. My daughter and I visited for a weekend and had a great experience for our first time using airb&b. I hope to stay there again when I come to visit.
40601,3378487,2013-01-20,3560895,Linda,"Robert was a welcoming host and the room and bath in his home are lovely.  This is a very convenient location, an easy walk to the main shopping/restaurant street in Jamaica Plain and also an easy walk to the T for public transportation into Boston.  "
40601,3970608,2013-04-01,2165283,Ben,"We had a great time in Robert's house. It is very nice, clean and is situated in a great area of Boston. Robert is also a fine host- he is really kind, helpful and friendly whilst also being sensitive to the personal space of guests. "
40601,4241964,2013-04-22,2817387,Gerard,"We had a perfect stay at Robert's place, he and his dog Rocco made us feel at home from the first moment. Robert is a most generous host, we spent some great time together but he also respected our privacy. His house lies in a very pretty neighbourhood where we felt very much at home. We can recommend staying there, good connections with the T to downtown and good restaurants, shops etc in the vicinity: we love J.P. When we get back to Boston we will certainly try to stay with Robert again!!
<br/>Gérard &Eva"
40601,4318949,2013-04-27,3152471,Michelle,"I had a great stay at Roberts. As other reviewers have noted, he is friendly but respectful of your space.  I have lived in several neighborhoods in Boston and the surrounding areas - Beacon Hill, South End, Jamaica Plain, Charlestown, Cambridge and Brookline - and recently have stayed in several hotels.  I was moving back to Boston and needed a short term stay.  I pursued AirBnB options in Beacon Hill, South End, Back Bay, JP and Brookline, and found Robert's to be a great value for the quality and price.  The stay lived up to expectations. Very quiet, comfortable bed, street with character and the orange line is very convenient.  20 minutes to the Back Bay station. "
40601,5450071,2013-07-01,5713976,Max,"Robert offers a great place to stay in Boston. The house offers enough place, own bathroom, a pretty garden to hang out, and a nice and laid back neighbourhood. The place is very clean and tidy, and if you are too, it wouldn't harm. The AC in summer is a blessing and not to underrate. Robert is a great host, he showed me around on my first day, gave me tips about the city and helped wherever he could. Having a bike there made things pretty comfortable, otherwise T and Bus are reachable within a short walk. I had a very good stay there and would definitely return if I pass by Boston."
40601,6210236,2013-08-04,2900145,Gray,"I can only echo the other reviews after my month stay!  Robert was a great host and very accommodating.  Local transport links within easy walking distance, along with a variety of local shops and restaurants.  Robert's house is very clean and tidy and is in a quiet neighborhood.  Robert allows you to have your own space but is also great company to hang out with.  I would definitely stay there again if I return to Boston. Plus Roco his dog was an added bonus.  "
40601,6433722,2013-08-12,7591922,Johannes,"Robert's house is like an Oasis. The house itself is immaculately clean and very tastefully furnished, and the carefully tended back yard with a nice deck overlooking flower beds and vegetables is very charming. The room is bright and provides ample closet space while the adjacent full bathroom is most convenient. Robert is a very helpful, discreet, and friendly host and I can only highly recommend his place. I had a wonderful time."
40601,6852409,2013-08-27,7545556,Yannick,"Does it suffice to say that we considered moving to Boston after this stay? We had an absolutely wonderful time at Robert's. He showed us around his neighborhood which has a lot to offer and is really quite a cool place. Robert lives on a quiet street. His house is very clean, very cozy and tastefully furnished with a lovely garden in which he plants tomatoes. There is air conditioning and the bed in our room was super comfy. The room has plenty of space for luggage. Robert was always helpful and lent us a card to use public transport (which is really easy in Boston, even the buses). He also lent us his bikes to take a bike tour along the many parks of Boston. A dinner party on the last evening was the perfect end for our stay. Highly recommended!"
40601,7789239,2013-10-03,5662660,Shimrit,"Staying at Robert was a delight. Robert is very friendly, but not intrusive, and had a lot of helpful suggestions. I had my own bathroom, which for me was important, and the bedroom was spacious (great bed). The house is great, a lot of stairs, but washer and dryer as well as fully equipped kitchen (made cookies). I personally am not a dog person, but Rocco really grow on me, especially since he is not a jump-on-you-lick-your-face kind of dog, and I found myself playing with him and petting him just so he won't give me sad faces :)
<br/>The neighborhood, Jamaica Plain (JP), is also cool, more laid back and inclusive, which I liked. Robert was very kind to show me around, the first day, pointing out restaurants and places that might be of interest. The lake is especially nice and I was fortunate to be around for the JP music festival and Open studios.
<br/>The T station is only 5 minutes away, and you're in downtown in less then 20 min. 
<br/>I loved Boston and having my home away from home for more than a month at Robert's was better than I ever expected. I would recommend his place to anybody visiting Boston who's not set at being in the middle of the hustle and bustle.
<br/>
<br/>Robert, thanks for everything, it's been a pleasure!"
40601,8018436,2013-10-13,7876660,Vic,"I stayed at Roberts place for a week. Robert is a very generous and personable host. On my first night he invited me to a dinner that he was hosting for some of his friends. He also invited me out to an event at the local Hibernian Hall and on the last day gave me a lift to the airport. Roberts house is spotless and all the equipment is high quality. Jamaica Plain is a lovely spot. It has a slightly hipster feel about it and the wooden clap board houses and tree lined streets give it a nice feel. There is also the two T line stations, which make getting into Boston centre really quick and easy, and the old converted brewery which is owned and run by Jamaica Plain Neighbourhood Development Corporation (a non profit). JPNDC have turned JP round in the last 20 years from a run down part of town to where it is now - property sells for $500 per sq ft.The converted brewery contains 40 or so businesses including a really great café and a restaurant. I met some of the locals and the owners of the restaurant on the last night and found them really friendly. 
<br/>
<br/>5 star - well done Robert."
